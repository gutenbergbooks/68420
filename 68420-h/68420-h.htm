<p>The studies on which this book is based were
begun during my tenure of the “William
Noble” Fellowship in English Literature at the
University of Liverpool, and I wish to thank the
members of the Fellowship Committee, and especially
Professor Elton, under whom I had for two years the
great privilege of working, for much valuable advice
and criticism. I must also express my sincere obligation
to the University for a generous grant towards
the cost of publication.</p>

<h1>POETIC DICTION</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE AGE OF PROSE AND REASON</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From the time of the publication of the first
Preface to the “Lyrical Ballads” (1798) the
poetical language of the eighteenth century, or
rather of the so-called “classical” writers of the
period, has been more or less under a cloud of suspicion.
The condemnation which Wordsworth then
passed upon it, and even the more rational and
penetrating criticism which Coleridge later brought to
his own analysis of the whole question of the language
fit and proper for poetry, undoubtedly led in the
course of the nineteenth century to a definite but
uncritical tendency to disparage and underrate the
entire poetic output of the period, not only of the
Popian supremacy, but even of the interregnum,
when the old order was slowly making way for the
new. The Romantic rebels of course have nearly
always received their meed of praise, but even in
their case there is not seldom a suspicion of critical
reservation, a sort of implied reproach that they
ought to have done better than they did, and that
they could and might have done so if they had reacted
more violently against the poetic atmosphere of
their age. In brief, what with the Preface to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
“Lyrical Ballads” and its successive expansions at
the beginning of the century, and what, some eighty
years later, with Matthew Arnold’s calm description
of the eighteenth century as an “age of prose and
reason,” the poetry of that period, and not only the
neo-classical portion of it, fared somewhat badly.
There could be no better illustration of the influence
and danger of labels and tags; “poetic diction,” and
“age of prose and reason” tended to become a sort
of critical legend or tradition, by means of which
eighteenth century verse, alike at its highest and its
lowest levels, could be safely and adequately understood
and explained.</p>

<p>Nowadays we are little likely to fall into the error
of assuming that any one cut and dried formula,
however pregnant and apt, could adequately sum up
the literary aspects and characteristics of an entire
age; the contributory and essential factors are too
many, and often too elusive, for the tabloid method.
And now that the poetry of the first half or so of the
eighteenth century is in process of rehabilitation, and
more than a few of its practitioners have even been
allowed access to the slopes, at least, of Parnassus, it
may perhaps be useful to examine, a little more
closely than has hitherto been customary, one of the
critical labels which, it would almost seem, has sometimes
been taken as a sort of generic description of
eighteenth century verse, as if “poetic diction” was
something which suddenly sprang into being when
Pope translated Homer, and had never been heard of
before or since.</p>

<p>This, of course, is to overstate the case, the more so
as it can hardly be denied that there is much to be
said for the other side. It may perhaps be put this
way, by saying, at the risk of a laborious assertion of
the obvious, that if poetry is to be written there must
be a diction in which to write it—a diction which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
whatever its relation to the language of contemporary
speech or prose may be, is yet in many essential
respects distinct and different from it, in that, even
when it does not draw upon a special and peculiar
word-power of its own, yet so uses or combines common
speech as to heighten and intensify its possibilities
of suggestion and evocation. If, therefore,
we speak of the “poetic diction” of the eighteenth
century, or of any portion of it, the reference ought to
be, of course, to the whole body of language in which
the poetry of that period is written, viewed as a
medium, good, bad, or indifferent, for poetical expression.
But this has rarely or never been the case; it
is not too much to say that, thanks to Wordsworth’s
attack and its subsequent reverberations, “poetic
diction,” so far as the eighteenth century is concerned,
has too often been taken to mean, “bad poetic diction,”
and it has been in this sense indiscriminately applied
to the whole poetic output of Pope and his school.</p>

<p>In the present study it is hoped, by a careful
examination of the poetry of the eighteenth century,
by an analysis of the conditions and species of its
diction, to arrive at some estimate of its value, of what
was good and what was bad in it, of how far it was the
outcome of the age which produced it, and how far a
continuation of inherited tradition in poetic language,
to what extent writers went back to their great predecessors
in their search for a fresh vocabulary, and
finally, to what extent the poets of the triumphant
Romantic reaction, who had to fashion for themselves
a new vehicle of expression, were indebted to their
forerunners in the revolt, to those who had helped to
prepare the way.</p>

<p>It is proposed to make the study both a literary and
a linguistic one. In the first place, the aim will be
to show how the poetic language, which is usually
labelled “the eighteenth century style,” was, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
certain of its most pronounced aspects, a reflex of the
literary conditions of its period; in the second place,
the study will be a linguistic one, in that it will deal
also with the words themselves. Here the attention
will be directed to certain features characteristic of,
though not peculiar to, the diction of the eighteenth
century poetry—the use of Latinisms, of archaic and
obsolete words, and of those compound words by
means of which English poets from the time of the
Elizabethans have added some of the happiest and
most expressive epithets to the language; finally, the
employment of abstractions and personifications will
be discussed.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THEORY OF POETICAL DICTION IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>About the time when Dryden was beginning
his literary career the preoccupation of men of
letters with the language as a literary instrument
was obvious enough. There was a decided
movement toward simplicity in both prose and poetry,
and, so far as the latter was concerned, it was in large
measure an expression of the critical reaction against
the “metaphysical” verse commonly associated with
the names of Donne and his disciples. Furetière in
his “Nouvelle Allegorique ou Histoire des dernier
troubles arrivez au Royaume d’Eloquence,” published
at Paris in 1658,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> expresses the parallel struggle which
had been raging amongst French poets and critics, and
the allegory he presents may be taken to symbolize
the general critical attitude in both countries.</p>

<p>Rhetoric, Queen of the Realm of Eloquence, and
her Prime Minister, Good Sense, are represented as
threatened by innumerable foes. The troops of the
Queen, marshalled in defence of the Academy, her
citadel, are the accepted literary forms, Histories,
Epics, Lyrics, Dramas, Romances, Letters, Sermons,
Philosophical Treatises, Translations, Orations, and
the like. Her enemies are the rhetorical figures and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the perversions of style, Metaphors, Hyperboles,
Similes, Descriptions, Comparisons, Allegories, Pedantries,
Antitheses, Puns, Exaggerations, and a host of
others. Ultimately the latter are defeated, and are
in some cases banished, or else agree to serve as
dependents in the realm of Eloquence.</p>

<p>We may interpret the struggle thus allegorically
expressed by saying that a new age, increasingly
scientific and rational in its outlook, felt it was high
time to analyze critically and accurately the traditional
canons and ideals of form and matter that classical
learning, since the Renaissance, had been able to
impose upon literature. This is not to say that
seventeenth century writers and critics suddenly
decided that all the accepted standards were radically
wrong, and should be thrown overboard; but some of
them at least showed and expressed themselves dissatisfied,
and, alongside of the unconscious and, as it
were, instinctive changes that reflected the spirit of
the age, there were deliberate efforts to re-fashion both
the matter and the manner of literary expression, to
give creative literature new laws and new ideals.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The movement towards purity and simplicity of
expression received its first definite statement in
Thomas Sprat’s “History of the Royal Society, 1667.”
One section of the History contains an account of the
French Academy, and Sprat’s efforts were directed
towards the formation of a similar body in England
as an arbiter in matters of language and style. The
ideal was to be the expression of “so many <i>things</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
almost in an equal number of <i>words</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A Committee
of the Royal Society, which included Dryden, Evelyn,
and Sprat amongst its members, had already met in
1664, to discuss ways and means of “improving the
English tongue,” and it was the discussions of this
committee which had doubtless led up to Evelyn’s
letter to Sir Peter Wyche, its chairman, in June 1665.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Evelyn there gives in detail his ideas of what an
English academy, acting as arbiter in matters of
vocabulary and style, might do towards purifying the
language. Twenty-three years later Joseph Glanvill
defined the new ideal briefly in a passage of his “Essay
Concerning Preaching”: “Plainness is a character of
great latitude and stands in opposition, First to <i>hard
words</i>: Secondly, to <i>deep and mysterious notions</i>:
Thirdly, to <i>affected Rhetorications</i>: and Fourthly, to
<i>Phantastical Phrases</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In short, the ideal to be
aimed at was the precise and definite language of
experimental science, but the trend of the times
tended to make it more and more that ideal of poetry
also which was later to be summed up in Dryden’s
definition of “wit” as a “propriety of thoughts and
words.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is of some little interest perhaps to note that it is
not until the end of the seventeenth century that the
word <i>diction</i> definitely takes on the sense which it now
usually bears as a term of literary criticism. In the
preface to “Sylvae, or The Second Part of Poetical
Miscellanies” (1685), Dryden even seems to regard the
term as not completely naturalized.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Moreover, the
critics and poets of the eighteenth century were for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the most part quite convinced that the special language
of poetry had begun with Dryden. Johnson asserted
this in his usual dogmatic fashion, and thus emphasized
the doctrine, afterwards vigorously opposed by Wordsworth,
that between the language of prose, and that
proper to poetry, there is a sharp distinction. “There
was therefore before the time of Dryden no poetical
diction.... Those happy combinations of words
which distinguished poetry from prose had been rarely
attempted; we had few elegancies or flowers of
speech.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Gray moreover, while agreeing that English
poetry had now a language of its own, declared in a
letter to West that this special language was the
creation of a long succession of English writers themselves,
and especially of Shakespeare and Milton, to
whom (he asserts) Pope and Dryden were greatly
indebted.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It is not very difficult to understand Dryden’s own
attitude, as laid down in the various Prefaces. He is
quite ready to subscribe to the accepted neo-classical
views on the language of poetry, but characteristically
reserves for himself the right to reject them, or to take
up a new line, if he thinks his own work, or that of his
contemporaries, is likely to benefit thereby. Thus in
the preface to “Annus Mirabilis” (1666) he boldly
claims the liberty to coin words on Latin models, and
to make use of technical details.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In his apology for
“Heroic Poetry and Poetic License” (1677) prefixed
to “The State of Innocence and Fall of Man,” his
operatic “tagging” of “Paradise Lost,” he seems to
lay down distinctly the principle that poetry demands
a medium of its own, distinct from that of prose,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
whilst towards the end of his literary career he reiterates
his readiness to enrich his poetic language from
any and every source, for “poetry requires ornament,”
and he is therefore willing to “trade both with the
living and the dead for the enrichment of our native
language.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But it is significant that at the same
time he rejects the technical terms he had formerly
advocated, apparently on the grounds that such terms
would be unfamiliar to “men and ladies of the first
quality.” Dryden has thus become more “classical,”
in the sense that he has gone over or reverted to the
school of “general” terms, which appeared to base
its ideal of expression on the accepted language of
cultured speakers and writers.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Toward the establishment of this principle of the
pseudo-classical creed the theory and practice of Pope
naturally contributed; indeed, it has been claimed
that it was in large measure the result of the profound
effect of the “Essay on Criticism,” or at least of the
current of thought which it represents, on the taste of
the age.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In the Essay, Pope, after duly enumerating
the various “idols” of taste in poetical thought and
diction, clearly states his own doctrine; as the poets’
aim was the teaching of “True Wit” or “Nature,”
the language used must be universal and general, and
neologisms must be regarded as heresies. For Pope,
as for Dryden, universal and general language meant
such as would appeal to the cultured society for whom
he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and in his practice he thus reflected the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
traditional attitude towards the question of language
as a vehicle of literary expression. A common
“poetics” drawn and formulated by the classical
scholars mainly (and often incorrectly) from Aristotle
had established itself throughout Western Europe, and
it professed to prescribe the true relation which should
exist between form and matter, between the creative
mind and the work of art.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The critical reaction against these traditional canons
had, as we have noted, already begun, but Pope and
his contemporaries are in the main supporters of the
established order, in full agreement with its guiding
principle that the imitation of “Nature” should be
the chief aim and end of art. It is scarcely necessary
to add that it was not “Nature” in the Wordsworthian
sense that was thus to be “imitated”; sometimes,
indeed, it is difficult to discover what was meant by
the term. But for Pope and his followers we usually
find it to mean man as he lives his life in this world,
and the phrase to “imitate Nature” might thus have
an ethical purpose, signifying the moral “improvement”
of man.</p>

<p>But to appreciate the full significance of this
“doctrine,” and its eighteenth century interpretation,
it is necessary to glance at the Aristotelian canon in
which it had its origin. For Aristotle poetry was an
objective “imitation” with a definite plan or purpose,
of human actions, not as they are, but as they ought
to be. The ultimate aim, then, according to the
<i>Poetics</i>, is ideal truth, stripped of the local and the
accidental; Nature is to be improved upon with means
drawn from Nature herself. This theory, as extracted
and interpreted by the Italian and French critics of
the Renaissance, was early twisted into a notion of
poetry as an agreeable falsity, and by the end of the
seventeenth century it had come to mean, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
with the French, the imitation of a selected and
embellished Nature, not directly, but rather through
the medium of those great writers of antiquity, such
as Homer and Virgil, whose works provided the
received and recognized models of idealized nature.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As a corollary to this interpretation of the Aristotelian
doctrine of ideal imitation, there appeared a
tendency to ignore more and more the element of
personal feeling in poetry,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and to concentrate attention
on the formal elements of the art. This tendency,
reinforced by the authority of the Horatian tag, <i>ut
pictura poesis</i> (“as is painting, so is poetry”), led
naturally, and in an ever-increasing degree, to the
formal identification of poetry with painting. Critics
became accustomed to discussing the elements in the
art of writing that correspond to the other elements in
pictorial art, such as light, colour, expression, etc.
And as the poet was to be an imitator of accepted
models, so also he was to be imitative and traditional
in using poetical colouring, in which phrase were
included, as Dryden wrote, “the words, the expressions,
the tropes and figures, the versification, and all
the other elegancies of sound.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> That this parallelism
directly encourages the growth of a set “poetic
diction” is obvious; the poet’s language was not to
be a reflection of a genuine emotion felt in the mind
for his words, phrases, and figures of speech, his
<i>operum colores</i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he must not look to Nature but to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
models. In brief, a poetical <i>gradus</i>, compiled from
accepted models, was to be the ideal source on which
the poet was to draw for his medium of expression.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to dwell long on this pseudo-classical
confusion of the two arts, as revealed in the
critical writings of Western Europe down to the very
outbreak of the Romantic revolt.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In English
criticism, Dryden’s “Parallel” was only one of many.
Of the eighteenth century English critics who developed
a detailed parallelism between pictorial and plastic art
on the one hand and poetry on the other, maintaining
that their standards were interchangeable, the most
important perhaps is Spence, whose “Polymetis”
appeared in 1747, and who sums the general position
of his fellow-critics on this point in the remark, “Scarce
anything can be good in a poetical description which
would appear absurd if represented in a statue or
picture.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The ultimate outcome of this confusion of
poetry and painting found its expression in the last
decade of the eighteenth century in the theory and
practice of Erasmus Darwin, whose work, “The
Botanic Garden,” consisted of a “second part,” “The
Loves of the Plants,” published in 1789, two years
before its inclusion with the “first part” the
“Economy of Vegetation,” in one volume. Darwin’s
theory of poetry is contained in the “Interludes”
between the cantos of his poems, which take the form
of dialogues between the “Poet” and a “Bookseller.”
In the Interlude to Canto 1 of Part II (“The Loves of
the Plants”) he maintains the thesis that poetry is a
process of painting to the eye, and in the cantos themselves
he proceeds with great zeal to show in practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
how words and images should be laid on like pigments
from the outside. The young Wordsworth himself, as
his early poems show, was influenced by the theory
and practice of Darwin, but Coleridge was not slow to
detect the danger of the elaborate word-painting that
might arise from the confusion of the two arts. “The
poet,” he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> “should paint to the Imagination
and not to the Fancy.” For Coleridge Fancy was the
“Drapery” of poetic genius, Imagination was its
“Soul” or its “synthetic and magical power,”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
he thus emphasized what may be regarded as one of
the chief distinctions between the pseudo-classical, and
the romantic, interpretations of the language of poetry.
In its groping after the “grand style,” as reflected in
a deliberate avoidance of accidental and superficial
“particularities,” and in its insistence on generalized
or abstract forms, eighteenth century poetry, or at
least the “neo-classical” portion of it, reflected its
inability to achieve that intensity of imaginative conception
which is the supreme need of all art.</p>

<p>The confusion between the two arts of poetry and
painting which Coleridge thus condemned did not, it
is needless to say, disappear with the eighteenth
century. The Romanticists themselves finally
borrowed that much-abused phrase “local colour”
from the technical vocabulary of the painter, and in
other respects the whole question became merged in
the symbolism of the nineteenth century where
literature is to be seen attempting to do the work of
both music and painting.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>As regards the language of poetry then—its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
vocabulary, the actual <i>words</i> in which it was to be
given expression—the early eighteenth century had
first this pseudo-classical doctrine of a treasury of
select words, phrases, and other “ornaments,” a
doctrine which was to receive splendid emphasis and
exemplification in Pope’s translation of Homer. But
alongside of this ideal of style there was another ideal
which Pope again, as we have seen, had insisted upon
in his “Essay on Criticism,” and which demanded
that the language of poetry should in general conform
to that of cultivated conversation and prose. These
two ideals of poetical language can be seen persisting
throughout the eighteenth century, though later
criticism, in its haste to condemn the <i>gradus</i> ideal,
has not often found time to do justice to the
other.</p>

<p>But, apart from these general considerations, the
question of poetic diction is rarely treated as a thing
<i>per se</i> by the writers who, after Dryden or Pope, or
alongside of them, took up the question. There are
no attempts, in the manner of the Elizabethans,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to
conduct a critical inquiry into the actual present
resources of the vernacular, and its possibilities as a
vehicle of expression. Though the attention is more
than once directed to certain special problems, on the
whole the discussions are of a general nature, and
centre round such points as the language suitable for
an Heroic Poem, or for the “imitation” of aspects
of nature, or for Descriptive Poetry, questions which
had been discussed from the sixteenth century onwards,
and were not exhausted by the time of Dr.
Johnson.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Goldsmith’s remarks, reflecting as they do a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
half-way attitude between the old order and the new,
are interesting. Poetry has a language of its own;
it is a species of painting with words, and hence he
will not condemn Pope for “deviating in some
instances from the simplicity of Homer,” whilst such
phrases as <i>the sighing reed</i>, <i>the warbling rivulet</i>, <i>the
gushing spring</i>, <i>the whispering breeze</i> are approvingly
quoted.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is thus somewhat surprising to find that
in his “Life of Parnell” he had pilloried certain
“misguided innovators” to whose efforts he attributed
the gradual debasing of poetical language since
the happy days when Dryden, Addison, and Pope
had brought it to its highest pitch of refinement.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
These writers had forgotten that poetry is “the
language of life” and that the simplest expression
was the best: brief statements which, if we knew
what Goldsmith meant by “life,” would seem to
adumbrate the theories which Wordsworth was to
expound as the Romantic doctrine.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson has many things to say on the subject
of poetic language, including general remarks and
particular judgments on special points, or on the work
of the poets of whom he treated in his “Lives.” As
might be expected, he clings tenaciously to the accepted
standards of neo-classicism, and repeats the old
commonplaces which had done duty for so long, pays
the usual tribute to Waller and Denham, but ascribes
the actual birth of poetical diction to the practice of
Dryden. What Johnson meant by “poetical diction”
is clearly indicated; it was a “system of words at
once refined from the grossness of domestic use, and
free from the harshness of terms appropriated to
different arts,”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that is, the language of poetry must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
shun popular and technical words, since language
is “the dress of thought” and “splendid ideas
lose their magnificence if they are conveyed by low
and vulgar words.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> From this standpoint, and
reinforced by his classical preference for regular
rhymes,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> all his particular judgments of his predecessors
and contemporaries were made; and when
this is remembered it is easier to understand, for
instance, his praise of Akenside<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and his criticism of
Collins.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Gray, however, perhaps the most scrupulous and
precise of all our poets with regard to the use of words
in poetry,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> has some pertinent things to say on the
matter. There is his important letter to West, already
referred to, with its dogmatic assertion that “the
language of the age is never the language of poetry,”
and that “our poetry has a language to itself,” an
assertion which, with other remarks of Gray, helps
to emphasize the distinction to be made between the
two ideals of poetical diction to be seen persisting
through the eighteenth century. It was generally
agreed that there must be a special language for
poetry, with all its artificial “heightening,” “licenses,”
and variations from the language of prose, to serve
the purpose of the traditional “Kinds,” especially
the Epic and the Lyric. This is the view taken by
Gray, but with a difference. He does not accept the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
conventional diction which Pope’s “Homer” had
done so much to perpetuate, and hence he creates a
poetic language of his own, a glittering array of words
and phrases, blending material from varied sources,
and including echoes and reminiscences of Milton and
Dryden.</p>

<p>The second ideal of style was that of which, as we
have seen, the canons had been definitely stated by
Pope, and which had been splendidly exemplified in
the satires, essays, and epistles. The aim was to
reproduce “the colloquial idiom of living society,”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
and the result was a plain, unaffected style, devoid
of the ornaments of the poetic language proper, and,
in its simplicity and directness, equally suitable for
either poetry or prose. Gray could make use of
this vehicle of expression, whenever, as in “The
Long Story,” or the fragmentary “Alliance of
Education and Government,” it was suitable and
adequate for his purpose; but in the main his
own practice stood distinct from both the eighteenth
century ideals of poetical language. Hence, as it
conformed to neither of the accepted standards,
Goldsmith and Johnson agreed in condemning his
diction, which was perhaps in itself sufficient proof
that Gray had struck out a new language for
himself.</p>

<p>Among the special problems connected with the
diction of poetry to which the eighteenth century
critics directed their attention, that of the use of
archaic and obsolete words was prominent. It had
been one of the methods by which the Elizabethans
had hoped to enrich their language, but contemporary
critics had expressed their disapproval, and it
was left to Jonson, in this as in other similar matters,
to express the reasonable view that “the eldest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the present and the newest of the past language is
best.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Dryden, when about to turn the “Canterbury
Tales” “into our language as it is now refined,”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> was
to express a similar common-sense view. “When
an ancient word,” he said, with his Horace no doubt
in his mind, “for its sound and significancy deserves
to be revived, I have that reasonable veneration for
antiquity to restore it. All beyond this is superstition.”</p>

<p>A few years later the long series of Spenserian
imitations had begun, so that the question of the poetic
use of archaic and obsolete words naturally came into
prominence. Pope, as might be expected, is to be
found among the opposition, and in the “Dunciad”
he takes the opportunity of showing his contempt for
this kind of writing by a satiric gird, couched in
supposedly archaic language:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">an attack which is augmented by the ironic comment
passed by “Scriblerus” in a footnote.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Nevertheless,
when engaged on his translation of Homer he had an
inclination, like Cowper, towards a certain amount of
archaism, though it is evident that he is not altogether
satisfied on the point.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In Gray’s well-known letter to West, mentioned
above, there is given a selection of epithets from
Dryden, which he notes as instances of archaic words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
preserved in poetry. Gray, as we know, had a keen
sense of the value of words, and his list is therefore of
special importance, for it appears to show that words
like <i>mood</i>, <i>smouldering</i>, <i>beverage</i>, <i>array</i>, <i>wayward</i>,
<i>boon</i>, <i>foiled</i>, etc., seemed to readers of 1742 much more
old-fashioned than they do to us. Thirty years or
so later he practically retracts the views expressed
in this earlier letter, in which he had admirably
defended the use in poetry of words obsolete in the
current language of the day. “I think,” he wrote
to James Beattie, criticizing “The Minstrel,”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> “that
we should wholly adopt the language of Spenser or
wholly renounce it.” And he goes on to object to
such words as <i>fared</i>, <i>meed</i>, <i>sheen</i>, etc., objections
which were answered by Beattie, who showed that
all the words had the sanction of such illustrious
predecessors as Milton and Pope, and who added that
“the poetical style in every nation abounds in old
words”—exactly what Gray had written in his letter
of 1742.</p>

<p>Johnson, it need hardly be said, was of Pope’s
opinion on this matter, and the emphatic protest
which he, alarmed by such tendencies in the direction
of Romanticism, apparent not only in the Spenserian
imitations, but still more in such signs of the times as
were to culminate in Percy’s “Reliques,” the Ossianic
“simplicities” of Macpherson, and the Rowley
“forgeries,” is evidence of the strength which the
Spenserian revival had by then gained. “To imitate
Spenser’s fiction and sentiments can incur no reproach,”
he wrote: “but I am very far from extending the same
respect to his diction and his stanza.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> To the end
he continued to express his disapproval of those who
favoured the “obsolete style,” and, like Pope, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
finally indulges in a metrical fling at the innovators:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Phrase that time has flung away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uncouth words in disarray;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tricked in antique ruff and bonnet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ode and Elegy and Sonnet.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Goldsmith too had his misgivings. “I dislike the
imitations of our old English poets in general,” he wrote
with reference to “The Schoolmistress,” “yet, on
this minute subject, the antiquity of the style produces
a very ludicrous solemnity.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>On this matter of poetic archaism, the point of view
of the average cultured reader, as distinct from the
writer, is probably accurately represented in one of
Chesterfield’s letters. Writing to his son,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> he was
particularly urgent that those words only should be
employed which were found in the writers of the
Augustan age, or of the age immediately preceding.
To enforce his point he carefully explained to the
boy the distinction between the pedant and the
gentleman who is at the same time a scholar; the
former affected rare words found only in the pages
of obscure or antiquated authors rather than those
used by the great classical writers.</p>

<p>This was the attitude adopted in the main by William
Cowper, who, after an early enthusiasm for the
“quaintness” of old words, when first engaged on
his translation of Homer, later repented and congratulated
himself on having, in his last revisal, pruned
away every “single expression of the obsolete kind.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
But against these opinions we have to set the frankly
romantic attitude of Thomas Warton, who, in his
“Observations on the Faerie Queen” (1754), boldly
asserts that “if the critic is not satisfied, yet the
reader is transported,” whilst he is quite confident
that Spenser’s language is not so difficult and obsolete
as it is generally supposed to be.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Here and there we also come across references to
other devices by which the poet is entitled to add to
his word-power. Thus Addison grants the right of
indulging in coinages, since this is a practice sanctioned
by example, especially by that of Homer and Milton.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Pope considered that only such of Homer’s compound
epithets as could be “done literally into English
without destroying the purity of our language” or
those with good literary sanctions should be adopted.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Gray, however, enters a caveat against coinages; in
the letter to Beattie, already quoted, he objects to the
word “infuriated,” and adds a warning not to “make
new words without great necessity; it is very hazardous
at best.”</p>

<p>Finally, as a legacy or survival of that veneration
for the “heroic poem,” which had found its latest
expression in Davenant’s “Preface to Gondibert”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
(1650), the question of technical words is occasionally
touched upon. Dryden, who had begun by asserting
that general terms were often a mere excuse for ignorance,
could later give sufficient reasons for the avoidance
of technical terms,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and it is not surprising to
find that Gray was of a similar opinion. In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
criticism of Beattie’s “Minstrel” he objects to the
terms <i>medium</i> and <i>incongruous</i> as being words of
art, which savour too much of prose. Gray, we may
presume, did not object to such words because they
were not “elegant,” or even mainly because they were
“technical” expressions. He would reject them
because, for him, with his keen sense of the value of
words, they were too little endowed with poetic colour
and imagination. When these protests are remembered,
the great and lasting popularity of “The Shipwreck”
(1762) of William Falconer, with its free
employment of nautical words and phrases, may be
considered to possess a certain significance in the
history of the Romantic reaction. The daring use of
technical terms in the poem must have given pleasure
to a generation of readers accustomed mainly to the
conventional words and phrases of the accepted
diction.</p>

<p>When we review the “theory” of poetical language
in the eighteenth century, as revealed in the sayings,
direct and indirect, of poets and critics, we feel that
there is little freshness or originality in the views
expressed, very little to suggest the changes that were
going on underneath, and which were soon to find
their first great and reasoned expression. Nominally,
it would seem that the views of the eighteenth century
“classicists” were adequately represented and summed
up in those of Johnson, for whom the ideal of poetical
language was that which Dryden had “invented,” and
of which Pope had made such splendid use in his
translation of Homer. In reality, the practice of the
“neo-classical” poets was largely influenced by the
critical tenets of the school to which they belonged,
especially by that pseudo-Aristotelian doctrine according
to which poetry was to be an “imitation” of the
best models, whilst its words, phrases, and similes
were to be such as were generally accepted and consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
by poetic use. It was this conventionalism,
reinforced by, as well as reflecting, the neo-classical
outlook on external nature, that resulted in the
“poetic diction” which Wordsworth attacked, and it
is important to note that a similar stereotyped
language is to be found in most of the contemporary
poetry of Western Europe, and especially in that of
France.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>We need not be surprised, therefore, to find that
neither Johnson, nor any of his “classical” contemporaries,
appears to attach any importance to the
fact that Pope in his essays and epistles had set up a
standard of diction, of which it is not too much to
say that it was an ideal vehicle of expression for the
thoughts and feelings it had to convey. So enamoured
were they of the pomp and glitter of the “Homer”
that they apparently failed to see in this real “Pope
style” an admirable model for all writers aiming at
lucidity, simplicity, and directness of thought. We
may see this clearly by means of an instructive comparison
of Johnson’s judgments on the two “Pope
styles.” “It is remarked by Watts,” he writes, “that
there is scarcely a happy combination of words or a
phrase poetically elegant in the English language
which Pope has not inserted into his version of
Homer.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> On the other hand, he is perhaps more
than unjust to Pope’s plain didactic style when he
speaks of the “harshness of diction,” the “levity
without elegance” of the “Essay on Man.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It was not until the neo-classical poetry was in its
death-agony that we meet with adequate appreciation
of the admirable language which Pope brought to
perfection and bequeathed to his successors. “The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
familiar style,” wrote Cowper to Unwin,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> “is of all
the styles the most difficult to succeed in. To make
verse speak the language of prose without being
prosaic—to marshal the words of it in such an order
as they might naturally take in falling from the lips
of an extemporary speaker, yet without meanness,
harmoniously, elegantly, and without seeming to displace
a syllable for the sake of the rhyme, is one of the
most arduous tasks a poet can undertake.” The
“familiar style,” which Cowper here definitely characterizes,
was in its own special province as good a model
as was the beautiful simplicity of Blake when “poetical
poetry” had once more come into its own; and it is
important to remember that this fact received due
recognition from both Wordsworth and Coleridge.
“The mischief,” wrote the former,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> “was effected not
by Pope’s satirical and moral pieces, for these entitle
him to the highest place among the poets of his class;
it was by his ‘Homer.’... No other work in the
language so greatly vitiated the diction of English
poetry.” And Coleridge, too, called attention to the
“almost faultless position and choice of words” in
Pope’s original compositions, in comparison with the
absurd “pseudo-poetic diction” of his translations of
Homer.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The “Pope style” failed to produce real
poetry—poetry of infinite and universal appeal,
animated with personal feeling and emotion not
merely because of its preference for the generic rather
than the typical, but because its practitioners for the
most part lacked those qualities of intense imagination
in which alone the highest art can have its birth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE “STOCK” DICTION OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Since the time when Wordsworth launched his
manifestoes on the language fit and proper for
poetry, it may almost be said that whenever the
term “poetic diction” is found used as a more or less
generic term of critical disparagement, it has been
with reference, implied or explicit, to the so-called
classical poetry of the Augustan ages. But the condemnation
has perhaps been given too wide an application,
and hence there has arisen a tendency to place
in this category all the language of all the poets who
were supposed to have taken Pope as their model, so
that “the Pope style” and “eighteenth century
diction” have almost become synonymous terms, as
labels for a lifeless, imitative language in which poets
felt themselves constrained to express all their thoughts
and feelings. This criticism is both unjust and misleading.
For when this “false and gaudy splendour”
is unsparingly condemned, it is not always recognized
or remembered that it is mainly to be found in the
descriptive poetry of the period.</p>

<p>It is sufficient to glance at the descriptive verse of
practically all the typical “classical” poets to discover
how generally true this statement is. We cannot say,
of course, that the varied sights and sounds of outdoor
life made no appeal at all to them; but what we do
feel is that whenever they were constrained to indulge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in descriptive verse they either could not, or would
not, try to convey their impressions in language of
their very own, but were content in large measure to
draw upon a common stock of dead and colourless
epithets. Local colour, in the sense of accurate and
particular observation of natural facts, is almost
entirely lacking; there is no writing with the eye on
the object, and it has been well remarked that their
highly generalized descriptions could be transferred
from poet to poet or from scene to scene, without any
injustice. Thus Shenstone<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> describes his birthplace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Romantic scenes of pendent hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And verdant vales, and falling rills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mossy banks, the fields adorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Damon, simple swain, was born—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">a quatrain which, with little or no change of epithet,
was the common property of the versifiers, and may
be met with almost everywhere in early eighteenth
century poetry. Every type of English scenery and
every phase of outdoor life finds its description in
lines of this sort, where the reader instinctively feels
that the poet has not been careful to record his individual
impressions or emotions, but has contented
himself with accepting epithets and phrases consecrated
to the use of natural description. A similar
inability or indifference is seen even in the attempts
to re-fashion Chaucer, or the Bible, or other old
material, where the vigour and freshness and colour of
the originals might have been expected to exercise a
salutary influence. But to no purpose: all must be
cast in the one mould, and clothed in the elegant diction
of the time. Thus in Dryden’s modernization of the
“Canterbury Tales” the beautiful simplicity of
Chaucer’s descriptions of the sights and sounds of
nature vanishes when garbed in the rapid and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
conventional phrases and locutions of the classicists.
Chaucer’s “briddes” becomes “the painted birds,”
a “goldfinch” is amplified into a “goldfinch with
gaudy pride of painted plumes,” whilst a plain and
simple mention of sunrise, “at the sun upriste,” has
to be paraphrased into</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Aurora had but newly chased the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And purpled o’er the sky with blushing light.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The old ballads and the Psalms suffered severely in the
same way.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the words most frequently used in this
stock poetic diction have usually some sort of connexion
with dress or ornament has not escaped notice,
and it has its own significance. It is, as it were, a
reflex of the fact that the nature poetry of the period
is in large measure the work of writers to whom social
life is the central fact of existence, for whom meadow,
and woodland, and running water, mountain and sea,
the silent hills, and the starry sky brought no inspiration,
or at least no inspiration powerful enough to lead
them to break through the shackles of conventionality
imposed upon them by the taste of their age. Words
like “paint” and “painted,” “gaudy,” “adorn,”
“deck,” “gilds” and “gilded,” “damasked,”
“enamelled,” “embroidered,” and dozens similar
form the stock vocabulary of natural description;
apart from the best of Akenside, and the works of one
or two writers such as John Cunningham, it can safely
be said that but few new descriptive terms were added
to the “nature vocabulary” of English poetry during
this period. How far English poetry is yet distant
from a recognition of the sea as a source of poetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
inspiration may be perhaps seen from the fact that its
most frequent epithet is the feeble term “watery,”
whilst the magic of the sky by night or day evokes no
image other than one that can be expressed by changes
rung on such words as “azure,” “concave,” “serene,”
“ætherial.” Even in “Night Thoughts,” where the
subject might have led to something new and fresh in
the way of a “star-vocabulary,” the best that Young
can do is to take refuge in such periphrases as “tuneful
spheres,” “nocturnal sparks,” “lucid orbs,” “ethereal
armies,” “mathematic glories,” “radiant choirs,”
“midnight counsellors,” etc.</p>

<p>And the same lack of direct observation and individual
expression is obvious whenever the classicists
have to mention birds or animals. Wild life had to
wait for White of Selborne, and for Blake and Burns
and Cowper and Wordsworth, to be observed with
accuracy and treated with sympathy; and it has been
well remarked that if we are to judge from their verse,
most of the poets of the first quarter of the eighteenth
century knew no bird except the goldfinch or nightingale,
and even these probably only by hearsay. For
the same generalized diction is usually called upon, and
birds are merely a “feathered,” “tuneful,” “plumy”
or “warbling” choir, whilst a periphrasis, allowing of
numerous and varied labels for the same animal, is
felt to be the correct thing. In Dryden sheep are
“the woolly breed” or “the woolly race”; bees are
the “industrious kind” or “the frugal kind”; pigs
are “the bristly care” or “the tusky kind”; frogs
are “the loquacious race”; crows, “the craven kind,”
and so on: “the guiding principle seems to be that
nothing must be mentioned by its own name.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Many of these stock epithets owed their appearance
of course to the requirements imposed upon poets by
their adherence to the heroic couplet. Pope himself
calls attention to the fact that the necessities of rhyme
led to the unceasing repetition of stereotyped phrases
and locutions:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where’er you find the “cooling western breeze.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the next line it “whispers through the trees”;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If crystal streams “with pleasing murmur creep”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The reader’s threaten’d, not in vain, with “sleep”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">adducing, with unconscious irony, the very rhymes prevalent
in much of his own practice.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It was also recognized by the versifiers that the
indispensable polish and “correctness” of the decasyllabic
line could only be secured by a mechanical use
of epithets in certain positions. “There is a vast
beauty [to me],” wrote Shenstone, “in using a word of
a particular nature in the 8th and 9th syllable of an
English verse. I mean what is virtually a dactyl.
For instance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And pykes, the tyrants of the wat’ry plains.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Let any person of any ear substitute <i>liquid</i> for <i>wat’ry</i>
and he will find the disadvantage.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Saintsbury has
pointed out<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> that the “drastic but dangerous device
of securing the undulating penetration of the line by
the use of the <i>gradus</i> epithet was one of the chief
causes of the intensely artificial character of the
versification and its attendant diction.... There
are passages in the ‘Dispensary’ and ‘The Rape of
the Lock,’ where you can convert the decasyllable
into the octosyllable for several lines together without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
detriment to sense or poetry by simply taking out these
specious superfluities.”</p>

<p>In the year of Dryden’s death (or perhaps in the
following year) there had appeared the “Art of
Poetry” by Edward Bysshe, whose metrical laws
were generally accepted, as authoritative, during the
eighteenth century. During the forty years of Dryden’s
literary career the supremacy of the stopped
regular decasyllabic couplet had gradually established
itself as the perfect form of verse. But Bysshe was
the first prosodist to formulate the “rules” of the
couplet, and in doing so he succeeded, probably
because his views reflected the general prosodic
tendencies of the time, in “codifying and mummifying”
a system which soon became erected into a creed.
“The foregoing rules (<i>of accent on the even places and
pause mainly at the 4th, 5th, or 6th syllable</i>) ought
indispensably to be followed in all our verses of 10
syllables: and the observation of them will produce
Harmony, the neglect of them harshness and discord.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Into this rigid mechanical mould contemporary
and succeeding versifiers felt themselves constrained
to place their couplets. But to pad out their
lines they were nearly always beset with a temptation
to use the trochaic epithets, of which numerous
examples have been given above. As a natural result
such epithets soon became part and parcel of the
poetic stock of language, and hence most of them were
freely used by poets, not because of any intrinsic
poetic value, but because they were necessary to
comply with the absurd mechanics of their vehicle of
expression.</p>

<p>Since the “Lives of the Poets” it has been customary
to regard this “poetic diction” as the peculiar invention
of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
century, and especially of Dryden and Pope, a belief
largely due to Johnson’s eulogies of these poets. As
an ardent admirer of the school of Dryden and Pope,
it was only natural that Johnson should express an
exalted opinion of their influence on the poetic practice
of his contemporaries. But others—Gray amongst
them—did not view their innovations with much complacency,
and towards the end of the century Cowper
was already foreshadowing the attack to be made by
Wordsworth and Coleridge in the next generation.
To Pope’s influence, he says in effect, after paying his
predecessor a more or less formal compliment, was due
the stereotyped form both of the couplet and of much
of the language in which it was clothed. Pope had
made</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">poetry a mere mechanic art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every warbler had his tune by heart;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in one of his letters he stigmatizes and pillories the
inflated and stilted phraseology of Pope, and especially
his translation of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Finally, Wordsworth and
Coleridge agreed in ascribing the “poetical diction,”
against which their manifestoes were directed, to that
source.</p>

<p>It is to be admitted that Pope’s translation is to
some extent open to the charge brought against it of
corrupting the language with a meretricious standard
of poetic diction. In his Preface he expresses his misgivings
as to the language fit and proper for an English
rendering of Homer, and indeed it is usually recognized
that his diction was, to a certain extent, imposed upon
him both by the nature of his original, as well as by
the lack of elasticity in his closed couplet. To the
latter cause was doubtless due, not only the use of
stock epithets to fill out the line, but also the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
repetition of certain words, due to the requirements of
rhyme, even at the expense of straining or distorting
their ordinary meaning. Thus <i>train</i>, for instance, on
account of its convenience as a rhyming word, is often
used to signify “a host,” or “body,” and similarly
<i>plain</i>, <i>main</i>, for the ocean. In this connexion it has
also been aptly pointed out that some of the defects
resulted from the fact that Pope had founded his own
epic style on that of the Latin poets, whose manner is
most opposed to Homer’s. Thus he often sought to
deck out or expand simple thoughts or commonplace
situations by using what he no doubt considered really
“poetical language,” and thus, for instance, where
Homer simply says, “And the people perished,” Pope
has to say, “And heaped the camp with mountains of
the dead.” The repeated use of periphrases: <i>feathered
fates</i>, for “arrows”; <i>fleecy breed</i> for “sheep”; <i>the
wandering nation of a summer’s day</i> for “insects”; <i>the
beauteous kind</i> for “women”; <i>the shining mischief</i> for
“a fascinating woman”; <i>rural care</i> for “the occupations
of the shepherd”; <i>the social shades</i> for “the
ghosts of two brothers,” may be traced to the same
influence.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>But apart from these defects the criticisms of
Coleridge and Wordsworth, and their ascribing of the
“poetical diction,” which they wished to abolish, to
the influence of Pope’s “Homer,” are to a large extent
unjust. Many of the characteristics of this “spurious
poetic language” were well established long before
Pope produced his translation. It is probable that
they are present to a much larger extent, for instance,
in Dryden; <i>painted</i>, <i>rural</i>, <i>finny</i>, <i>briny</i>, <i>shady</i>, <i>vocal</i>,
<i>mossy</i>, <i>fleecy</i>, come everywhere in his translations, and
not only there. Some of his adjectives in y are
more audacious than those of Pope: <i>spongy clouds</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
<i>chinky hives</i>, <i>snary webs</i>, <i>roomy sea</i>, etc. Most of the
periphrases used by Pope and many more are already
to be found in Dryden: “summer” is <i>the sylvan
reign</i>; “bees,” <i>the frugal</i> or <i>industrious kind</i>;
“arrows,” <i>the feathered wood</i> or <i>feathered fates</i>;
“sheep,” <i>the woolly breed</i>; “frogs,” <i>the loquacious
race</i>! From all Pope’s immediate predecessors and
contemporaries similar examples may be quoted,
like Gay’s</p>

<p>Pope then may justly be judged “not guilty,” at
least “in the first degree,” of having originated the
poetic diction which Johnson praised and Wordsworth
condemned; in using it, he was simply using the
stock language for descriptive poetry, whether original
or in translations, which had slowly come into being
during the last decade of the seventeenth century.
If it be traced to its origins, it will be found that most
of it originated with that poet who may fairly be
called the founder of the English “classical” school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of poetry—to Milton, to whom in large measure is due,
not merely the invention, but also, by the very potency
of the influence exercised by his great works, its vogue
in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Before the time of Milton, it is not too much to say,
even when we remember the practice of Spenser and
Donne and their followers, that there was no special
language for poetry, little or nothing of the diction
consecrated solely to the purposes of poets. The
poets of the Elizabethan age and their immediate
successors had access to all diction, upon which they
freely drew. But it seems natural, indeed inevitable,
that for Milton, resolved to sing of things “unattempted
yet in prose or rhyme,” the ordinary language
of contemporary prose or poetry should be found
lacking. He was thus impelled, we may say, consciously
and deliberately to form for himself a special
poetical vocabulary, which, in his case, was abundantly
justified, because it was so essentially fitted to his
purpose, and bore the stamp of his lofty poetic genius.</p>

<p>This poetical vocabulary was made up of diverse
elements. Besides the numerous “classical” words,
which brought with them all the added charm of
literary reminiscence, there were archaisms, and words
of Latin origin, as well as words deliberately coined
on Latin and Greek roots. But it included also most
of the epithets of which the eighteenth century versifiers
were so fond. Examples may be taken
from any of the descriptive portions of the “Paradise
Lost”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(IV, 334)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">About me round I saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And liquid lapse of murmuring streams.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(VIII, 260-263)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Other phrases, like “vernal bloom,” “lucid stream,”
“starry sphere,” “flowery vale,” “umbrageous
grots,” were to become the worn-out penny-pieces
of the eighteenth century poetical mint. Milton
indeed seems to have been one of the great inventors
of adjectives ending in y, though in this respect
he had been anticipated by Browne and others, and
especially by Chapman, who has large numbers of
them, and whose predilection for this method of
making adjectives out of nouns amounts almost to
an obsession.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Milton was also perhaps the great innovator with
another kind of epithet, which called forth the censure
of Johnson, who described it as “the practice of giving
to adjectives derived from substantives the terminations
of participles,” though the great dictator is here
attacking a perfectly legitimate device freely used by
the Jacobeans and by most of the poets since their
time.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Nor are there wanting in Milton’s epic instances
of the idle periphrases banned by Wordsworth: <i>straw-built
citadel</i> for “bee-hive,” <i>vernal bloom</i> for “spring
flowers,” <i>smutty grain</i> for “gunpowder,” <i>humid train</i>
for the flowery waters of a river, etc.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>With Milton, then, may be said to have originated
the “poetic diction,” which drew forth Wordsworth’s
strictures, and which in the sequel proved a dangerous
model for the swarm of versifiers who essayed to
borrow or imitate it for the purpose of their dull and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
commonplace themes. How much the Miltonic language,
as aped and imitated by the “landscape
gardeners and travelling pedlars” of the eighteenth
century, lost in originality and freshness, may be felt,
rather than described, if we compare so well-known a
passage as the following with any of the quotations
given earlier:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">Yet not the more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clear Spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That wash thy hallowed feet and warbling flow.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(P.L. III, 26-30)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the minor poets of the eighteenth century, who,
by their mechanical imitations, succeeded in reducing
Milton’s diction to the level of an almost meaningless
jargon, had had every encouragement from their
greater predecessors and contemporaries. The process
of depreciation may be seen already in Dryden, and it
is probably by way of Pope that much of the Miltonic
language became part of the eighteenth century poetic
stock-in-trade. Pope was a frequent borrower from
Milton, and, in his “Homer” especially, very many
reminiscences are to be found, often used in an artificial,
and sometimes in an absurd, manner.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Moreover,
Pope’s free and cheapened use of many of Milton’s
descriptive epithets did much to reduce them to the
rank of merely conventional terms, and in this respect
the attack of Wordsworth and Coleridge was not
without justice. But on the whole the proper conclusion
would seem to be that what is usually labelled
as “the <i>Pope</i> style” could with more justice and
aptness be described as “the pseudo-Miltonic style.”
It is true that the versifiers freely pilfered the “Homer,”
and the vogue of much of the stock diction is thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
due to that source, but so far as Pope himself is concerned
there is justice in his plea that he left this
style behind him when he emerged from “Fancy’s
maze” and “moralized his song.”</p>

<p>To what extent this catalogue of lifeless words and
phrases had established itself as the poetical thesaurus
is to be seen in the persistency with which it maintained
its position until the very end of the century,
when Erasmus Darwin with a fatal certainty evolved
from it all its worst features, and thus did much
unconsciously to crush it out of existence. James
Thomson is rightly regarded as one of the most
important figures in the early history of the Romantic
Revolt, and he has had merited praise for his attempts
to provide himself with a new language of his own.
In this respect, however, he had been anticipated by
John Philips, whose “Splendid Shilling” appeared in
1705, followed by “Cyder” a year later. Philips,
though not the first Miltonic imitator, was practically
the first to introduce the Miltonic diction and phrases,
whilst at the same time he acquired the knack of adding
phrases of his own to the common stock. He was
thus an innovator from whom Thomson himself
learned not a little.</p>

<p>But though the “Seasons” is ample testimony to
a new and growing alertness to natural scenery,
Thomson found it hard to escape from the fetters of
the current poetic language. We feel that he is at
least trying to write with his eye steadily fixed upon
the object, but he could perhaps hardly be expected to
get things right from the very beginning. Thus a
stanza from his “Pastoral Entertainment” is purely
conventional:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The place appointed was a spacious vale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fanned always by a cooling western gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which in soft breezes through the meadow stray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And steal the ripened fragrances away—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">while he paraphrases a portion of the sixth chapter of
St. Matthew into:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe the rising lily’s snowy grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe the various vegetable race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They neither toil nor spin, but careless grow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet see how warm they blush, how bright they glow,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where the stock terms scarcely harmonize with the
simple Biblical diction. He was well aware of the
attendant dangers and difficulties, and in the first book
of “The Seasons” he gives expression to the need he
feels of a language fit to render adequately all that he
sees in Nature.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But though there is much that is
fresh and vivid in his descriptive diction, and much
that reveals him as a bold pioneer in poetic outlook
and treatment, the tastes and tendencies of his age
were too strong entirely to be escaped. Birds are the
<i>plumy</i>, or <i>feathered people</i>, or <i>the glossy kind</i>,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and a
flight of swallows is <i>a feathered eddy</i>; sheep are <i>the
bleating kind</i>, etc. In one passage (“Spring,” ll. 114-135)
he deals at length with the insects that attack the
crops without once mentioning them by name: they
are <i>the feeble race</i>, <i>the frosty tribe</i>, <i>the latent foe</i>, and
even <i>the sacred sons of vengeance</i>. He has in general
the traditional phraseology for the mountains and the
sea, though a few of his epithets for the mountains, as
<i>keen-air’d</i> and <i>forest-rustling</i>, are new. He speaks of
the Alps as <i>dreadful</i>, <i>horrid</i>, <i>vast</i>, <i>sublime</i>. <i>Shaggy</i> and
<i>nodding</i> are also applied to mountains as well as to
rocks and forests; winter is usually described in the
usual classical manner as <i>deformed</i> and <i>inverted</i>.
Leaves are the <i>honours</i> of trees, paths are <i>erroneous</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
caverns <i>sweat</i>, etc., and he also makes large use of
Latinisms.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>John Dyer (1700-1758), though now and then conventional
in his diction, has a good deal to his credit,
and is a worthy contemporary of the author of “The
Seasons.” Thus in the “Country Walk” it is the old
stock diction he gives us:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Look upon that <i>flowery plain</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How the sheep surround their <i>swain</i>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And there behold a <i>bloomy mead</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A silver stream, a willow shade;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and much the same thing is to be found in “The
Fleece,” published in 1757:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The crystal dews, impearl’d upon the grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are touched by Phœbus’ beams and mount aloft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With various clouds to paint the azure sky;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst he has almost as many adjectives in y as Ambrose
Philips. But these are more than redeemed by the
new descriptive touches which appear, sometimes
curiously combined with the stereotyped phrases, as
in “The Fleece” (Bk. III):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The scatter’d mists reveal the dusky hills;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grey dawn appears; the golden morn ascends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And paints the glittering rocks and purple woods.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor must we forget “Grongar Hill,” which has justly
received high praise for its beauties and felicities of
description.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to illustrate further the vogue
of this sort of diction in the first half of the eighteenth
century; it is to be found everywhere in the poetry of
the period, and the conventional epithets and phrases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
quoted from Dyer and Thomson may be taken as
typical of the majority of their contemporaries. But
this lifeless, stereotyped language has also invaded the
work of some of the best poets of the century, including
not only the later classicists, but also those who have
been “born free,” and are foremost among the
Romantic rebels. The poetic language of William
Collins shows a strange mixture of the old style and
the new. That it was new and individual is well seen
from Johnson’s condemnation, for Johnson recognized
very clearly that the language of the “Ode on
the Popular Superstitions of the Highlands” did not
conform to what was probably his own view that the
only language fit and proper for poetry was such as
might bear comparison with the polish and elegance
of Pope’s “Homer.” It is not difficult to make due
allowance for Johnson when he speaks of Collins’s
diction as “harsh, unskilfully laboured, and injudicially
selected”; we deplore the classical bias, and are
content enough to recognize and enjoy for ourselves
the matchless beauty and charm of Collins’s diction
at its best. Yet much of the language of his earlier
work betrays him as more or less a poetaster of the
eighteenth century. The early “Oriental Eclogues”
abound in the usual descriptive details, just as if the
poet had picked out his words and phrases from the
approved lists. Thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the cool fountain or the shady grove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still, with the shepherd’s innocence her mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and even in the “Ode on the Popular Superstitions”
there were expressions like <i>watery surge</i>, <i>sheeny gold</i>,
though now and then the “new” diction is strikingly
exemplified in a magnificent phrase such as <i>gleamy
pageant</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>When Collins has nothing new to say his poetic
language is that of his time, but when his inspiration
is at its loftiest his diction is always equal to the task,
and it is then that he gives us the unrivalled felicities
of “The Ode to Evening.”</p>

<p>Amongst all the English poets there has probably
never been one, even when we think of Tennyson,
more careful and meticulous (or “curiously elaborate,”
as Wordsworth styled it) about the diction of his
verses, the very words themselves, than Gray. This
fact, and not Matthew Arnold’s opinion that it was
because Gray had fallen on an “age of prose,” may
perhaps be regarded as sufficient to explain the comparative
scantiness of his literary production. He
himself, in a famous letter, has clearly stated his ideal
of literary expression: “Extreme conciseness of
expression, yet pure, perspicuous, and musical, is one
of the grand beauties of lyrical poetry.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Hence all
his verses bear evidence of the most painstaking labour
and rigorous self-criticism, almost as if every word
had been weighed and assessed before being allowed
to appear. His correspondence with Mason and
Beattie, referred to in the previous chapter, shows the
same fastidiousness with regard to the work of others.
Gray indeed, drawing freely upon Milton and Dryden,
created for himself a special poetic language which
in its way can become almost as much an abuse as
the otiosities of many of his predecessors and contemporaries—the
“cumbrous splendour” of which
Johnson complained. Yet he is never entirely free
from the influence of the “classical” diction which,
for Johnson, represented the ideal. His earliest work
is almost entirely conventional in its descriptions, the
prevailing tone being exemplified in such phrases as
<i>the purple year</i>, <i>the Attic Warbler pours her throat</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
(Ode on “The Spring”), whilst in the “Progress of
Poesy,” lines like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Through verdant vales and Ceres’ golden reign</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are not uncommon, though of course the possibility
of the direct influence of the classics, bringing with it
the added flavour of reminiscence, is not to be ignored
in this sort of diction. Moreover, a couplet from the
fragmentary “Alliance of Education and Government”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Scent the new fragrance of <i>the breathing rose</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And quaff <i>the pendent vintage</i> as it grows—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is almost typical, apart from the freshness of the
epithet <i>breathing</i>, of what Wordsworth wished to
abolish. Even the “Elegy” has not escaped
the contagion: <i>storied urn</i> or <i>animated bust</i> is
perilously akin to the pedantic periphrases of the
Augustans.</p>

<p>Before passing to a consideration of the work
of Johnson and Goldsmith, who best represent
the later eighteenth century development of the
“classical” school of Pope, reference may be made
to two other writers. The first of these is Thomas
Chatterton. In that phase of the early Romantic
Movement which took the form of attempts to revive
the past, Chatterton of course played an important
part, and the pseudo-archaic language which he
fabricated for the purpose of his “Rowley” poems
is interesting, not only as an indication of the trend
of the times towards the poetic use of old and obsolete
words, but also as reflecting, it would seem, a genuine
endeavour to escape from the fetters of the conventional
and stereotyped diction of his day. On the
other hand, in his avowedly original work, Chatterton’s
diction is almost entirely imitative. He has scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
a single fresh image or description; his series of
“Elegies” and “Epistles” are clothed in the current
poetic language. He uses the stock expressions,
<i>purling streams</i>, <i>watery bed</i>, <i>verdant vesture of the
smiling fields</i>, along with the usual periphrases,
such as <i>the muddy nation</i> or <i>the speckled folk</i>
for “frogs.” One verse of an “Elegy” written
in 1768 contains in itself nearly all the conventional
images:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye variegated children of the Spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye blossoms blushing with the pearly dew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye birds that sweetly in the hawthorn sing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye flowery meads, lawns of verdant hue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It can be judged from these examples how a stereotyped
mode of expression may depreciate to a large
extent the value of much of the work of a poet of real
genius. Chatterton is content in most of his avowedly
“original” work to turn his poetic thoughts into the
accepted moulds, which is all the more surprising
when we remember his laborious methods of
manufacturing an archaic diction for his mediaeval
“discoveries,”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> even if we may assume that
it reflected a strong desire for something fresh and
new.</p>

<p>A poet of much less genius, but one who enjoyed
great contemporary fame, was William Falconer,
whose “Shipwreck,” published in 1762, was the most
popular sea-poem of the eighteenth century. The
most striking characteristic of the descriptive parts
of the poem is the daring and novel use of technical
sea-terms, but apart from this the language is purely
conventional. The sea is still the same <i>desert-waste</i>,
<i>faithless deep</i>, <i>watery way</i>, <i>world</i>, <i>plain</i>, <i>path</i>, or <i>the
fluid plain</i>, <i>the glassy plain</i>, whilst the landscape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
catalogue is as lifeless as any of the descriptive passages
of the early eighteenth century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">on every spray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warbling birds exalt their evening lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blithe skipping o’er yon hill the fleecy train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Join the deep chorus of the lowing plain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When he leaves this second-hand description, and
describes scenes actually experienced and strongly
felt, Falconer’s language is correspondingly fresh and
vivid, the catastrophe of the shipwreck itself, for
example, being painted with extraordinary power.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>When we come to Johnson and Goldsmith, here
again a distinction must be made between the didactic
or satiric portion of their work and that which is
descriptive. Johnson’s didactic verse, marked as it is
by a free use of inversion and ellipsis, rarely attains
the clearness and simplicity of Goldsmith’s, whilst he has
also much more of the stock descriptive terms and
phrases. His “Odes” are almost entirely cast in this
style. Thus in “Spring”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now o’er the rural Kingdom roves</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Soft Pleasure with her laughing train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Love warbles in the vocal groves</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And vegetation plants the plains,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst exactly the same stuff is turned out for a love
poem, “To Stella”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not the soft sighs of vernal gales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fragrance of the flowery vales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The murmurs of the crystal rill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vocal grove, the verdant hill.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Though there is not so much of this kind of otiose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
description in the poems of Goldsmith, yet Mr. Dobson’s
estimate of his language may be accepted as a
just one: “In spite of their beauty and humanity,”
he says, “the lasting quality of ‘The Traveller’ and
‘The Deserted Village’ is seriously prejudiced by his
half-way attitude between the poetry of convention
and the poetry of nature—between the <i>gradus</i> epithet
of Pope and the direct vocabulary of Wordsworth.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Thus when we read such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The slow canal, the yellow-blossomed vale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Traveller,” ll. 293-4)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we feel that Goldsmith too has been writing with his
eye on the object, and even in such a line as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The breezy covert of the warbling grove</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(<i>Ibid.</i>, 360)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">there is a freshness of description that compensates
for the use of the hackneyed <i>warbling grove</i>. On the
other hand, there are in both pieces passages which it
is difficult not to regard as purely conventional in
their language. Thus in “The Traveller,” the diction,
if not entirely of the stock type, is not far from it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye glittering towns, with wealth and splendour crowned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye fields, where summer spreads profusion round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye lakes, whose vessels catch the busy gale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye bending swains, that dress the flowery vale,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so on for another dozen lines.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Only the slightest traces, however, of this mechanical
word-painting appear in “The Deserted Village,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
almost the only example of the stereotyped phrase
being in the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These simple blessings of <i>the lowly train</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(l. 252).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus whilst Goldsmith in much of his work continues
the classical school of Pope, alike in his predilection
for didactic verse and his practice of the heroic couplet,
in his poetic language he is essentially individual. In
his descriptive passages he rarely uses the conventional
jargon, and the greater part of the didactic and moral
observations of his two most famous poems is written
in simple and unadorned language that would satisfy
the requirements of the Wordsworthian canon.</p>

<p>That pure and unaffected diction could be employed
with supreme effect in other than moral and didactic
verse was soon to be shown in the lyric poetry of
William Blake, who, about thirty years before Wordsworth
launched his manifestoes, evolved for himself a
poetic language, wonderful alike in its beauty and
simplicity. In those of the “Songs of Innocence” and
“The Songs of Experience,” which are concerned with
natural description, the epithets and expressions that
had long been consecrated to this purpose find little
or no place. Here and there we seem to catch echoes
of the stock diction, as in the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">the starry floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the watery shore</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of the Introduction to the “Songs of Experience,”
or the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">happy, silent, <i>moony</i> beams</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of “The Cradle Song”; but in each case the expressions
are redeemed and revitalized by the pure and
joyous singing note of the lyrics of which they form
part. Only once is Blake to be found using the conventional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
epithet, when in his “Laughing Song” he
writes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">the <i>painted</i> birds laugh in the shade,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst with his usual unerring instinct he marks down
the monotonous smoothness of so much contemporary
verse in that stanza of his ode “To the Muses” in
which, as has been well said, the eighteenth century
dies to music:<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How have you left the ancient love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That bards of old enjoyed in you!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The languid strings do scarcely move,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sound is forced, the notes are few.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not that he altogether escaped the blighting influence
of his time. In the early “Imitation of Spenser,” we
get such a couplet as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To sit in council with his modern peers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And judge of tinkling rhimes and elegances terse,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst the “vicious diction” Wordsworth was to condemn
is also to be seen in this line from one of the early
“Songs”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">and Phœbus fir’d my vocal rage.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even as late as 1800 Blake was capable of writing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Receive this tribute from a harp sincere.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But these slight blemishes only seem to show up in
stronger light the essential beauty and nobility of his
poetical style.</p>

<p>But the significance of Blake’s work in the purging
and purifying of poetic diction was not, as might
perhaps be expected, recognized by his contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and immediate successors. For Coleridge, writing
some thirty years later, it was Cowper, and his less
famous contemporary Bowles, who were the pioneers
in the rejecting of the old and faded style and the
beginning of the new, the first to combine “natural
thoughts with natural diction.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Coleridge’s opinion
seems to us now to be an over-statement, but we
rather suspect that Cowper was not unwilling to
regard himself as an innovator in poetic language. In
his correspondence he reveals himself constantly pre-occupied
with the question of poetic expression, and
especially with the language fit and proper for his
translation of Homer. His opinion of Pope’s attempt
has already been referred to, but he himself was well
aware of the inherent difficulties.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> He had, it would
seem, definite and decided opinions on the subject of
poetic language; he recognized the lifelessness of the
accepted diction, which, rightly or wrongly, he attributed
especially to the influence of Pope’s “Homer,”
and tried to escape from its bondage. His oft-quoted
thesis that in the hands of the eighteenth century poets
poetry had become a “mere mechanic art,” he
developed at length in his ode “Secundum Artem,”
which comprises almost a complete catalogue of the
ornaments which enabled the warblers to have their
tune by heart. What Cowper in that ode pillories—“the
trim epithets,” the “sweet alternate rhyme,”
the “flowers of light description”—were in the main
what were to be held up to ridicule in the <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i> prefaces; Wordsworth’s attack is here anticipated
by twenty years.</p>

<p>But, as later in the case of Wordsworth, Cowper in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his early work has not a little of the language which he
is at such pains to condemn. Thus Horace again
appears in the old familiar guise,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now o’er the spangled hemisphere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffused the starry train appear</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Fifth Satire”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst even in “Table Talk” we find occasional conventional
descriptions such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nature...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spreads the fresh verdure of the fields and leads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dancing Naiads through the dewy meads.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is little of this kind of description in “The
Task.” Now and then we meet with examples of the
old periphrases, such as the <i>pert voracious kind</i> for
“sparrows,” or the description of kings as the <i>arbiters
of this terraqueous swamp</i>, though many of these
pseudo-Miltonic expressions are no doubt used for
playful effect. In those parts of the poem which deal
with the sights and sounds of outdoor life the images
are new and fresh, whilst in the moral and didactic
portions the language is, as a rule, uniformly simple
and direct. But for the classical purity of poetical
expression in which the poet is at times pre-eminent,
it is perhaps best to turn to his shorter poems, such
as “To Mary,” or to the last two stanzas of “The
Castaway,” and especially to some of the “Olney
Hymns,” of the language of which it may be said that
every word is rightly chosen and not one is superfluous.
Indeed, it may well be that these hymns,
together with those of Watts and Wesley,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> which by
their very purpose demanded a mode of expression
severe in its simplicity, but upon which were stamped
the refinement and correct taste of the scholars and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
gentlemen who wrote them—it may well be that the
more natural mode of poetic diction which thus arose
gave to Wordsworth a starting point when he began
to expound and develop his theories concerning the
language of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Whilst Cowper was thus at once heralding, and to a
not inconsiderable extent exemplifying, the Romantic
reaction in form, another poet, George Crabbe, had by
his realism given, even before Cowper, an important
indication of one characteristic aspect of the new
poetry.</p>

<p>But though the force and fidelity of his descriptions
of the scenery of his native place, and the depth and
sincerity of his pathos, give him a leading place
among those who anticipated Wordsworth, other
characteristics stamp him as belonging to the old
order and not to the new. His language is still largely
that perfected by Dryden and Pope, and worked to
death by their degenerate followers. The recognized
“elegancies” and “flowers of speech” still linger on.
A peasant is still a <i>swain</i>, poets are <i>sons of verse</i>, fishes
<i>the finny tribe</i>, country folk <i>the rural tribe</i>. The word
<i>nymph</i> appears with a frequency that irritates the
reader, and how ludicrous an effect it could produce
by its sudden appearance in tales of the realistic type
that Crabbe loved may be judged from such examples
as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It soon appeared that while this nymph divine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moved on, there met her rude uncivil kine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Whilst he succeeds in depicting the life of the rustic
poor, not as it appears in the rosy tints of Goldsmith’s
pictures, but in all its reality—sordid, gloomy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
stern, as it for the most part is—the old stereotyped
descriptions are to be found scattered throughout
his grimly realistic pictures of the countryside. Thus
when Crabbe writes of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">tepid meads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lawns irriguous and the blooming field</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we feel that he has not had before his eyes the real
scenes of his Suffolk home, but that he has been content
to recall and imitate the descriptive stock-in-trade
that had passed current for so many years;
even the later “Tales,” published up to the years
when Shelley and Keats were beginning their activities,
are not free from this defect.</p>

<p>About ten years before Wordsworth launched his
manifestoes, there were published the two works of
Erasmus Darwin, to which reference has already been
made, and in which this stock language was unconsciously
reduced to absurdity, not only because of the
themes on which it was employed, but also because
of the fatal ease and facility with which it was used.
It is strange to think that but a few years before the
famous sojourn of Coleridge and Wordsworth on the
Quantocks, “The Loves of the Plants,” and its fellow,
should have won instant and lasting popularity.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>That Darwin took himself very seriously is to be
seen from “The Interludes,” in which he airs his
views,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> whilst in his two poems he gave full play to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
his “fancy” (“‘theory’ we cannot call it,” comments
De Quincey) that nothing was strictly poetic
except what is presented in visual image. This in
itself was not bad doctrine, as it at least implied that
poetry should be concrete, and thus reflected a desire
to escape from the abstract and highly generalized
diction of his day. But Darwin so works his dogma
to death that the reader is at first dazzled, and finally
bewildered by the multitude of images presented, in
couplets of monotonous smoothness, in innumerable
passages, such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On twinkling fins my pearly nations play</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or wind with sinuous train their trackless way:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My plumy pairs in gay embroidery dressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Form with ingenious bill the pensile nest.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Botanic Garden,” I)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Still there is something to be said for the readers who
enjoyed having the facts and theories of contemporary
science presented to them in so coloured and fantastic
a garb.</p>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten that the youthful Wordsworth
was much influenced by these poems of Darwin,
so that his early work shows many traces of the very
pseudo-poetic language which he was soon to condemn.
Thus in “An Evening Walk”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> there are such stock
phrases as “emerald meads,” “watery plains,” the
“forest train.”</p>

<p>In “Descriptive Sketches” examples are still more
numerous. Thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And amorous music on the water dies,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which might have come direct from Pope, or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here all the seasons revel hand-in-hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>The old epithet <i>purple</i> is frequently found (<i>purple</i>
lights and vernal plains, the <i>purple</i> morning, the
fragrant mountain’s <i>purple</i> side), and there are a few
awkward adjectives in y (“the <i>piny</i> waste”), whilst
a gun is described as the <i>thundering tube</i>.</p>

<p>Few poems indeed are to be found in the eighteenth
century with so many fantastic conceits as these
1793 poems of Wordsworth. Probably, as has been
suggested, the poet was influenced to an extent
greater than he himself imagined by “The Botanic
Garden,” so that the poetical devices freely employed
in his early work may be the result of a determination
to conform to the “theory” of poetry which Darwin
in his precept and practice had exemplified. Later,
the devices which had satisfied him in his first youthful
productions must have appeared to him as more or
less vicious, and altogether undesirable, and in disgust
he resolved to exclude at one stroke all that he was
pleased to call “poetic diction.” But, little given
to self-criticism, when he penned his memorable
Prefaces, he fixed the responsibility for “the extravagant
and absurd diction” upon the whole body of
his predecessors, unable or unwilling to recognize
that he himself had begun his poetic career with a free
use of many of its worst faults.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Of the stock diction of eighteenth century poetry
we may say, then, that in the first place it is in large
measure a reflection of the normal characteristic
attitude of the poets of the “neo-classical” period
towards Nature and all that the term implies. The
“neo-classical” poets were but little interested in
Nature; the countryside made no great appeal to
them, and it was the Town and its teeming life that
focused their interest and attention. Man, and his
life as a social being, was their “proper study”;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
and this concentration of interest finds its reflection
in the new and vivid language of the “essays,” satires,
and epistles, whilst in the “nature poetry” the
absence of genuine feeling is only too often betrayed
by the dead epithets of the stock diction each poet
felt himself at liberty to draw upon according to his
needs. It is scarcely necessary to remind ourselves
that it is in Pope’s “Pastorals” and the “Homer,”
not in the “Dunciad” or “The Essay on Man,”
that the stock words, phrases, and similes are to be
found, and the remark is equally true of most of the
poets of his period. But Pope has been unjustly
pilloried, for the stock diction did not originate with
him. It is true that the most masterly and finished
examples of what is usually styled “the eighteenth
century poetic diction” are to be found in his work
generally, and no doubt the splendour of his translation
of Homer did much to establish a vogue for many
of the set words and phrases. At the same time
the supremacy of the heroic couplet which he did so
much to establish played its part in perpetuating the
stock diction, the epithets of which were often technically
just what was required to give the decasyllabic
verse the desired “correctness” and “smoothness.”
But it is unjust to saddle him with the responsibility
for the lack of originality evident in many of
his successors and imitators.</p>

<p>The fact that this stock language is not confined
to the neo-classical poets proper, but is found to a
large extent persisting to the very end of the eighteenth
century, and even invading the early work of the
writer who led the revolt against it, is indicative of
another general cause of its widespread prevalence.
Briefly, it may be said that not only did the conventional
poetic diction reflect in the main the average
neo-classical outlook on external nature; it reflected
also the average eighteenth century view as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
nature of poetical language, which regarded its words
and phrases as satisfying the artistic canon, not in
virtue of the degree in which they reflected the individual
thought or emotion of the poet, but according
as they conformed to a standard of language based on
accepted models.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">LATINISM IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>There is now to be noticed another type of
eighteenth century poetic diction which was
in its way as prevalent, and, it may be added,
as vicious, as the stock diction which has been discussed
in the previous chapter. This was the use of
a latinized vocabulary, from the early years of the
century down to the days when the work of Goldsmith,
Cowper, and Crabbe seemed to indicate a sort of
interregnum between the old order and the new.</p>

<p>This fashion, or craze, for “latinity” was not of
course a sudden and special development which came
in with the eighteenth century: it was rather the
culmination of a tendency which was not altogether
unconnected with the historic development of the
language itself. As a factor in literary composition,
it had first begun to be discussed when the Elizabethan
critics and men of letters were busying themselves
with the special problem of diction. Latinism was
one of the excesses to which poets and critics alike
directed their attention, and their strictures and
warnings were such as were inevitable and salutary
in the then transitional confusion of the language.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
In the early years of the seventeenth century this
device for strengthening and ornamenting the language
was adopted more or less deliberately by such poets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
as Phineas and Giles Fletcher, especially the latter,
who makes free use of such coinages as <i>elamping</i>,
<i>appetence</i>, <i>elonging</i>, etc.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The example of the Fletchers in thus adding to their
means of literary expression was soon to be followed
by a greater poet. When Milton came to write his
epics, it is evident, as has been said, that he felt the
need for a diction in keeping with the exalted theme
he had chosen, and his own taste and temperament,
as well as the general tendencies of his age, naturally
led him to make use of numerous words of direct
or indirect “classical” origin. But his direct coinages
from Latin and Greek are much less than has often
been supposed.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> What he seems to have done in many
cases was to take words the majority of which had
been recently formed, usually for scientific or philosophic
purposes, and incorporate them in his poetical
vocabulary. Thus <i>Atheous</i>, <i>attrite</i>, <i>conflagrant</i>, <i>jaculation</i>,
<i>myrrhine</i>, <i>paranymph</i>, <i>plenipotent</i>, etc., are
instances of classical formations which in most cases
seem, according to “The New English Dictionary,”
to have made their first literary appearance shortly
before the Restoration. In other instances Milton’s
latinisms are much older.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> What is important is the
fact that Milton was able to infuse these and many
similar words with a real poetic power, and we may be
sure that the use of such words as <i>ethereal</i>, <i>adamantine</i>,
<i>refulgent</i>, <i>regal</i>, whose very essence, as has been
remarked, is suggestiveness, rather than close definition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
was altogether deliberate.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In addition to this
use of a latinized vocabulary, there is a continuous
latinism of construction, which is to be found in the
early poems, but which, as might be expected, is
most prominent in the great epics, where idioms like
<i>after his charge received</i> (P.L., V 248), <i>since first her
salutation heard</i> (P.R., II, 107) are frequent.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Milton, we may say, of purpose prepense made or
culled for himself a special poetical vocabulary which
was bound to suffer severely at the hands of incompetent
and uninspired imitators. But though the
widespread use of latinized diction is no doubt largely
to be traced to the influence of Milton at a time when
“English verse went Milton mad,” it may perhaps
also be regarded as a practice that reflected to a certain
extent the general literary tendencies of the Augustan
age.</p>

<p>When Milton was writing his great epics Dryden
was just beginning his literary career, but though
there are numerous examples of latinisms in the works
of the latter, they are not such as would suggest that
he had been influenced to any extent by the Miltonic
manner of creating a poetical vocabulary. There is
little or no coinage of the “magnificent” words which
Milton used so freely, though latinized forms like
<i>geniture</i>, <i>irremeable</i>, <i>praescious</i>, <i>tralineate</i>, are frequent.
Dryden, however, as might be expected, often uses
words in their original etymological sense. Thus
besides the common use of <i>prevent</i>, <i>secure</i>, etc., we find
in the translation of the “Metamorphoses”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He had either <i>led</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy mother then,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where <i>led</i> is used in the sense of Latin <i>ducere</i> (marry)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
and “<i>refers</i> the limbs,” where “refers” means
“restores.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Examples are few in Dryden’s original
works, but “Annus Mirabilis” furnishes instances
like the <i>ponderous ball expires</i>, where “expires” means
“is blown forth,” and “each wonted room <i>require</i>”
(“seek again”), whilst there is an occasional reminiscence
of such Latin phrases as “manifest of crimes”
for <i>manifestus sceleris</i> (“Ab. and Achit.”).</p>

<p>What has been said of the latinisms of Dryden
applies also to those of Pope. Words like <i>prevent</i>,
<i>erring</i>, <i>succeed</i>, <i>devious</i>, <i>horrid</i>, <i>missive</i>, <i>vagrant</i>, are
used with their original signification, and there are
passages like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For this he bids the <i>nervous</i> artists vie.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Imitations of Latin constructions are occasionally
found:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Some god has told them, or themselves survey</div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><i>The bark escaped</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Phrases like “<i>fulgid</i> weapons,” “roseate <i>unguents</i>,”
“<i>circumfusile</i> gold,” “<i>frustrate</i> triumphs,” etc., are
probably coinages imposed by the necessities of
translation. Other similar phrases, such as (tears)
“<i>conglobing</i> on the dust,” “with <i>unctuous</i> fir <i>foment</i> the
flame,” seem to anticipate something of the absurdity
into which this kind of diction was later to fall.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the latinisms found in the works
of Dryden and Pope are not usually deliberate creations
for the purpose of poetic ornament. They are such
as would probably seem perfectly natural in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
seventeenth and early eighteenth century, when the
traditions of classical study still persisted strongly,
and when the language of prose itself was still receiving
additions from that source. Moreover, the large
amount of translation done by both poets from the
classics was bound to result in the use of numerous
classical terms and constructions.</p>

<p>In 1705 there appeared the “Splendid Shilling” of
John Philips, followed by his “Cyder” and other poems
a year later. These poems are among the first of the
Miltonic parodies or imitations, and, being written in
blank verse, they may be regarded as heralding the
struggle against the tyranny of the heroic couplet.
Indeed, blank verse came to be distinctly associated
with the Romantic movement, probably because it
was considered that its structure was more encouraging
to the unfettered imagination than the closed couplets
of the classicists. It is thus interesting to note that
the reaction in form, which marks one distinct aspect
of Romanticism, was really responsible for some of the
excesses against which the manifestoes afterwards
protested; for it is in these blank verse poems
especially that there was developed a latinism both of
diction and construction that frequently borders on
the ludicrous, even when the poet’s object was not
deliberately humorous.</p>

<p>In “Blenheim” terms and phrases such as <i>globous
iron</i>, <i>by chains connexed</i>, etc., are frequent, and the
attempts at Miltonic effects is seen in numerous
passages like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Upborne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By frothy billows thousands float the stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In cumbrous mail, with love of farther shore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Confiding in their hands, that sed’lous strive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To cut th’ outrageous fluent.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In “Cyder” latinisms are still more abundant: <i>the
nocent brood</i> (of snails), <i>treacle’s viscuous juice</i>, <i>with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
grain incentive stored</i>, <i>the defecated liquour</i>, <i>irriguous
sleep</i>, as well as passages like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor from the sable ground expect success</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor from cretacious, stubborn or jejune,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bards with volant touch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Traverse loquacious strings.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This kind of thing became extremely common and
persisted throughout the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it may here be remarked that the
publication of Philips’s poems probably gave to Lady
Winchilsea a hint for her poem “Fanscombe Barn.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Philips, as has been noted, was one of the very first
to attempt to use Milton’s lofty diction, and his
latinized sentence structure for commonplace and
even trivial themes, and no doubt his experiment,
having attracted Lady Winchilsea’s attention,
inspired her own efforts at Miltonic parody, though
it is probably “Cyder” and “The Splendid Shilling,”
rather then “Paradise Lost,” that she takes as her
model. Thus the carousings of the tramps forgathered
in Fanscombe Barn are described:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">the swarthy bowl appears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Replete with liquor, globulous to fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And threat’ning inundation o’er the brim;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the whole poem shows traces of its second-hand
inspiration.</p>

<p>Even those who are now remembered chiefly as
Spenserian imitators indulge freely in a latinized
style when they take to blank verse. Thus William
Thompson, who in his poem “Sickness” has many
phrases like “the arm <i>ignipotent</i>,” “<i>inundant</i> blaze”
(Bk. I), “terrestrial stores medicinal” (Bk. III),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
with numerous passages, of which the following is
typical:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">the poet’s mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Effluence essential of heat and light)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now mounts a loftier wing when Fancy leads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glittering track, and points him to the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Excursive.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(Bk. IV)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">William Shenstone, the author of one of the most
successful of the Spenserian imitations, is more
sparing in this respect, but even in his case passages
such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Of words indeed profuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of gold tenacious, their torpescent soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clenches their coin, and what electric fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall solve the frosty grip, and bid it flow?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Economy,” Part I)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are not infrequent.</p>

<p>But it is not only the mere versifiers who have
succumbed to this temptation. By far the most
important of the early blank verse poems was
Thomson’s “Seasons,” which, first appearing from
1726-1730, was subsequently greatly revised and
altered up to the edition of 1746, the last to be issued
in the author’s lifetime.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The importance and success
of “The Seasons” as one of the earliest indications of
the “Return to Nature” has received adequate
recognition, but Thomson was an innovator in the
style, as well as in the matter, of his poem. As Dr.
Johnson remarked, he saw things always with the
eyes of a poet, and the quickened and revived interest
in external nature which he reflects inevitably impelled
him to search for a new diction to give it expression.
We can see him, as it were, at work trying to replace
the current coinage with a new mintage of his own,
or rather with a mixed currency, derived partly from
Milton, and partly from his own resources. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
diction is thus in some degrees as artificial as the
stock diction of his period, especially when his attempts
to emulate or imitate the magnificence of Milton
betray him into pomposity or even absurdity; but
his poetical language as a whole is leavened with so
much that is new and his very own as to make it clear
that the Romantic revival in the style, as well as in
the contents, of poetry has really begun. The resulting
peculiarities of style did not escape notice in his
own time. He was recognized as the creator of a new
poetical language, and was severely criticized even
by some of his friends. Thus Somerville urged with
unusual frankness a close revision of the style of “The
Seasons”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Read Philips much, consider Milton more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But from their dross extract the purer ore:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To coin new words or to restore the old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In southern lands is dangerous and bold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But rarely, very rarely, will succeed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When minted on the other side of Tweed.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thomson’s comment on this criticism was emphatic:
“Should I alter my ways I should write poorly. I
must choose what appears to be the most significant
epithet or I cannot proceed.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Hence, though lines
and whole passages of “The Seasons” were revised,
and large additions made, the characteristics of the
style were on the whole preserved. And one of the
chief characteristics, due partly to the influence of
Milton, and partly to the obvious fact that for Thomson
with new thoughts and impressions to convey to his
readers, the current and conventional vocabulary
of poetry needed reinforcement, is an excessive use
of latinisms.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>Thus in “Spring” we find, e.g., “<i>prelusive</i> drops,”
“the <i>amusive</i> arch” (the rainbow), “the torpid sap
<i>detruded</i> to the root,” etc., as well as numerous passages
such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Joined to these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Innumerous songsters in the freshening shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of new-sprung leaves, their modulations mix</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mellifluous.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Spring,” 607 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In “Summer” the epithet <i>gelid</i> appears with almost
wearisome iteration, with other examples like <i>flexile</i>
wave, <i>the fond sequacious bird</i>, etc., while the cloud
that presages a storm is called “the small prognostic”
and trees are “the noble sons of potent heat
and floods.” Continuous passages betray similar
characteristics:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From thee the sapphire, solid ether, takes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its hue cerulean and of evening tinct.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 149 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Autumn</i> furnishes even more surprising instances:
the stag “<i>adhesive</i> to the track,” the sands “strowed
<i>bibulous</i> above,” “forests huge <i>incult</i>,” etc., as well as
numerous passages of sustained latinism.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>In “Winter,” which grew from an original 405 lines
in 1726 to 1,069 lines in 1746, latinism of vocabulary
is not prominent to the same extent as in the three
previous books, but the following is a typical sample:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime in sable cincture shadows vast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep-tinged, and damp and congregated clouds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the vapoury turbulence of heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Involves the face of things.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(ll. 54 foll.)<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The revisions after 1730 do not show any great
pruning, or less indulgence in these characteristics;
rather the contrary, for many of them are additions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
which did not appear until 1744. Now and then
Thomson has changed his terms and epithets. Thus
in the lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">the potent sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Melts into</i> limpid air the high-raised clouds</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 199)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the expression “melts into” has replaced the earlier
“attenuates to.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> One of the best of the emendations,
at least as regards the disappearance of a
latinism, is seen in “Summer” (48-9), where the
second verse of the couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The meek-eyed morn appears, mother of dews,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At first <i>faint-gleaming</i> in the dappled east</div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">has replaced the</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Mildly elucent</i> in the streaky east</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of the earlier version. Often Thomson’s latinisms
produce no other effect on the reader than that of mere
pedantry. Thus in passages such as</p>

<p class="noindent">(where there is Latin <i>order</i> as well as diction), it is
certain that the terms in question have little or no
poetic value, and that simpler words in nearly every
case would have produced greater effects. Now and
then, as later in the case of Cowper, the pedantry is,
we may suppose, deliberately playful, as when he
speaks of the cattle that</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The words illustrated above are rarely, of course,
Thomson’s own coinage. Many of them (e.g. <i>detruded</i>,
<i>hyperborean</i>, <i>luculent</i>, <i>relucent</i>, <i>turgent</i>) date from the
sixteenth century or earlier, though from the earliest
references to them given in the “New English Dictionary”
it may be assumed that Thomson was not
always acquainted with the sources where they are
first found, and that to him their “poetic” use is
first due. In some cases Milton was doubtless the
immediate source from which Thomson took such
words, to use them with a characteristic looseness of
meaning.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>It would be too much to say that Thomson’s use of
such terms arises merely out of a desire to emulate
the “grand style”; it reflects rather his general
predilection for florid and luxurious diction. Moreover,
it has been noted that an analysis of his latinisms
seems to point to a definite scheme of formation.
Thus there is a distinct preference for certain groups of
formations, such as adjectives in “-ive” (<i>affective</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
<i>amusive</i>, <i>excursive</i>, etc.), or in “-ous” (<i>irriguous</i>,
<i>sequacious</i>), or Latin participle forms, such as <i>clamant</i>,
<i>turgent</i>, <i>incult</i>, etc. In additions Latin words are
frequently used in their original sense, common
instances being <i>sordid</i>, <i>generous</i>, <i>error</i>, <i>secure</i>, <i>horrid</i>,
<i>dome</i>, while his blank verse line was also characterized
by the free use of latinized constructions.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Thomson’s frequent use of the sandwiched noun,
“flowing rapture bright” (“Spring,” 1088), “gelid
caverns woodbine-wrought,” (“Summer,” 461), “joyless
rains obscure” (“Winter,” 712), often with the
second adjective used predicatively or adverbially,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">High seen the Seasons lead, <i>in sprightly dance</i></div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 1212)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is also worthy of note.</p>

<p>Yet it can hardly be denied that the language of
“The Seasons” is in many respects highly artificial,
and that Thomson was to all intents and purposes
the creator of a special poetic diction, perhaps even
more so than Gray, who had to bear the brunt of
Wordsworth’s fulminations. But on the whole his
balance is on the right side; at a time when the
majority of his contemporaries were either content
to draw drafts on the conventional and consecrated
words, phrases, and similes, or were sedulously
striving to ape the polished plainness of Pope, he
was able to show that new powers of expression
could well be won from the language. His nature
vocabulary alone is sufficient proof of the value of
his contributions to the poetic wealth of the language,
not a few of his new-formed compounds especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
being expressive and beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> His latinisms are
less successful because they can hardly be said to belong
to any diction, and for the most part they must be
classed among the “false ornaments” derided by
Wordsworth;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> not only do they possess none of that
mysterious power of suggestion which comes to words
in virtue of their employment through generations of
prose and song, but also not infrequently their meaning
is far from clear. They are never the spontaneous
reflection of the poet’s thought, but, on the contrary,
they appear only too often to have been dragged in
merely for effect.</p>

<p>This last remark applies still more forcibly to
Somerville’s “Chase,” which appeared in 1735. Its
author was evidently following in the wake of
Thomson’s blank verse, and with this aim freely
allows himself the use of an artificial and inflated
diction, as in many passages like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Cull each salubrious plant, with bitter juice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Concoctive stored, and potent to allay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each vicious ferment.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>About the same time Edward Young was probably
writing his “Night Thoughts,” though the poem was
not published until 1742. Here again the influence
of Thomson is to be seen in the diction, though no
doubt in this case there is also not a little that derives
direct from Milton. Young has Latin formations like
<i>terraqueous</i>, <i>to defecate</i>, <i>feculence</i>, <i>manumit</i>, as well
as terms such as <i>avocation</i>, <i>eliminate</i>, and <i>unparadize</i>,
used in their original sense. In the second instalment
of the “Night Thoughts” there is a striking increase
in the number of Latin terms, either borrowed directly,
or at least formed on classical roots, some of which must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
have been unintelligible to many readers. Thus
<i>indagators</i> for “seekers,” <i>fucus</i> for “false brilliance,”
<i>concertion</i> for “intimate agreement,” and <i>cutaneous</i> for
“external,” “skin deep”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All the distinctions of this little life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are quite cutaneous.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is difficult to understand the use of such terms when
simple native words were ready at hand, and the
explanation must be that they were thought to add
to the dignity of the poem, and to give it a
flavour of scholarship; for the same blemishes appear
in most of the works published at this time. Thus in
Akenside’s “Pleasures of the Imagination” (1744)
there is a similar use of latinized terms: <i>pensile
planets</i>, <i>passion’s fierce illapse</i>, <i>magnific praise</i>, though
the tendency is best illustrated in such passages as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">that trickling shower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Piercing through every crystalline convex</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of clustering dewdrops to their flight opposed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Recoil at length where, concave all behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The internal surface of each glassy orb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repels their forward passage into air.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In “The Poet” there is a striking example of
what can only be the pedantic, even if playful,
use of a cumbrous epithet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On shelves <i>pulverulent</i>, majestic stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His library.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Similar examples are to be found in “The Art of
Preserving Health” by John Armstrong, published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in the same year as Akenside’s “Pleasures.” The
unpoetical nature of this subject may perhaps be
Armstrong’s excuse for such passages as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mournful eclipse or planets ill-combined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Portend disastrous to the vital world;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but this latinizing tendency was perhaps never responsible
for a more absurd periphrasis than one to be
found in the second part of the poem, which treats of
“Diet”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor does his gorge the luscious bacon rue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of solid milk.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The high Miltonic manner was likewise attempted by
John Dyer in “The Fleece,” which appeared in 1757,
and by James Grainger in “The Sugar Cane” (1764),
to mention only the most important. Dyer, deservedly
praised for his new and fresh descriptive diction, has
not escaped this contagion of latinism: <i>the globe
terraqueous</i>, <i>the cerule stream</i>, <i>rich sapinaceous loam</i>,
<i>detersive bay salt</i>, etc., while elsewhere there are obvious
efforts to recapture the Miltonic cadence. In “The
Sugar Cane” the tendency is increased by the necessity
thrust upon the poet to introduce numerous
technical terms. Thus</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">though all thy mills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crackling, o’erflow with a redundant juice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor tastes the liquor; coction long demands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And highest temper, ere it saccharize.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Joseph Warton had written his one
blank verse poem “The Enthusiast” (1740), when
he was only eighteen years old. But though both he
and his brother Thomas are among the most important
of the poets who show the influence of Milton most
clearly, that influence reveals itself rather in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
matter of thought than of form, and there is in “The
Enthusiast” little of the diction that marred so many
of the blank verse poems. Only here and there may
traces be seen, as in the following passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">fairer she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In innocence and homespun vestments dress’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than if cerulean sapphires at her ears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shone pendent.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is still less in the poems of Thomas Warton, who
was even a more direct follower of Milton than his
elder brother. There is scarcely one example of a
Latinism in “The Pleasures of Melancholy,” which
is really a companion piece to “The Enthusiast.”
The truth is that it was Milton’s early work—and
especially “Il Penseroso”—that affected most deeply
these early Romanticists, and even their blank verse
is charged with the sentiments and phrases of Milton’s
octosyllabics. Thus the two poets, who were among
the first to catch something of the true spirit of Milton,
have little or nothing of the cumbersome and pedantic
diction found so frequently in the so-called “Miltonics”
of the eighteenth century, and this in itself is one
indication of their importance in the earlier stages of
the Romantic revival.</p>

<p>This is also true in the case of Collins and Gray, who
are the real eighteenth century disciples of Milton.
Collins’s fondness for personified abstractions may
perhaps be attributed to Milton’s influence, but there
are few, if any, traces of latinism in his pure and simple
diction. Gray was probably influenced more than he
himself thought by Milton, and like Milton he made
for himself a special poetical language, which owes not
a little to the works of his great exemplar. But
Gray’s keen sense of the poetical value of words, and
his laborious precision and exactness in their use,
kept him from any indulgence in coinages. Only one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
or two latinisms are to be found in the whole of his
work, and when these do occur they are such as would
come naturally to a scholar, or as were still current in
the language of his time. Thus in “The Progress of
Poesy” he has</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">this <i>pencil</i> take,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where “pencil” stands for “brush” (Latin, <i>pensillum</i>);
whilst in a translation from Statius he gives
to <i>prevent</i> its latinized meaning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">the champions, trembling at the sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Prevent</i> disgrace.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is also a solitary example in the “Elegy” in
the line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Can Honour’s voice <i>provoke</i> the silent dust.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The contemporary fondness for blank verse had
called forth the strictures of Goldsmith in his “Inquiry
into the Present State of Polite Learning,” and his
own smooth and flowing couplets have certainly none
of the pompous epithets which he there condemns.
His diction, if we except an occasional use of the stock
descriptive epithets, is admirable alike in its simplicity
and directness, and the two following lines from “The
Traveller” are, with one exception,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the only examples
of latinisms to be found in his poems:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While sea-born gales their <i>gelid</i> wings expand,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fall blunted from each <i>indurated</i> heart.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson, who represented the extreme classicist
position with regard to blank verse and other tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of the Romantic reaction, had a good deal to say in
the aggregate about the poetical language of his
predecessors and contemporaries. But the latinism
of the time, which was widespread enough to have
attracted his attention, does not seem to have provoked
from him any critical comment. His own
poetical works, even when we remember the “Vanity
of Human Wishes,” where plenty of instances of
Latin idiom are to be found, are practically free from
this kind of diction, though this does not warrant the
inference that he disapproved of it. We know that
his prose was latinized to a remarkable extent, so that
his “sesquipedalian terminology” has been regarded
as the fountain-head of that variety of English which
delights in “big,” high-sounding words. But his
ideal, we may assume, was the polished and elegant
diction of Pope, and his own verse is as free from
pedantic formations as is “The Lives of the Poets,”
which perhaps represents his best prose.</p>

<p>It is in the works of a poet who, though he continues
certain aspects of neo-classicism, yet announces
unmistakably the coming of the new age, that we find
a marked use of a deliberately latinized diction.
Cowper has always received just praise for the purity
of his language; he is, on the whole, singularly free
from the artificialities and inversions which had
marked the accepted poetic diction, but, on the other
hand, his language is latinized to an extent that has
perhaps not always been fully realized.</p>

<p>This is, however, confined to “The Task” and to
the translation of the “Iliad.” In the former case
there is first a use of words freely formed on Latin
roots, for most of which Cowper had no doubt abundant
precedents,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> but which, in some cases, must have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
coined by him, perhaps playfully in some instances;
<i>twisted form vermicular</i>, <i>the agglomerated pile</i>, <i>the
voluble and restless earth</i>, etc. Other characteristics
of this latinized style are perhaps best seen in continuous
passages such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">he spares me yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, though himself so polished, still reprieves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The obsolete prolixity of shade</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(Bk. I, ll. 262 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or in such a mock-heroic fling as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The stable yields a stercoraceous heap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impregnated with quick fermenting salts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And potent to resist the freezing blast.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On these and many similar occasions Cowper has
turned his predilection to playful account, as also
when he diagnoses the symptoms of gout as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">pangs arthritic that infest the toe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of libertine excess,</div>

<p class="noindent">or speaks of monarchs and Kings as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is still freer use of latinisms in the “Homer”:<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
<i>her eyes caerulean</i>, <i>the point innocuous</i>, <i>piercing accents
stridulous</i>, <i>the triturated barley</i>, <i>candent lightnings</i>,
<i>the inherent barb</i>, <i>his stream vortiginous</i>, besides such
passages as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">nor did the Muses spare to add</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Responsive melody of vocal sweets.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>The instances given above fully illustrate on the
whole the use of a latinized diction in eighteenth
century poetry.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> It must not, however, be supposed
that the fashion was altogether confined to the blank
verse poems. Thus Matthew Prior in “Alma,” or
“The Progress of the Mind,” has passages like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">the word obscene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or harsh which once elanced must ever fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Irrevocable,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst Richard Savage in his “Wanderer” indulges
in such flights as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">his breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A nitrous damp that strikes petrific death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One short stanza by William Shenstone, from his
poem “Written in Spring, 1743,” contains an obvious
example in three out of its four lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Again the labouring hind inverts the soil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Again the merchant ploughs the tumid wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Another spring renews the soldier’s toil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And finds me vacant in the rural cave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is in the blank verse poems that the fashion
is most prevalent, and it is there that it only too often
becomes ludicrous. The blind Milton, dying, lonely
and neglected, a stranger in a strange land, is hardly
likely to have looked upon himself as the founder of
a “school,” or to have suspected to what base uses his
lofty diction and style were to be put, within a few
decades of his death, by a swarm of poetasters who
fondly regarded themselves as his disciples.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
early writers of blank verse, such as John Philips,
frankly avowed themselves imitators of Milton, and
there can be little doubt that in their efforts to catch
something of the dignity and majesty of their model
the crowd of versifiers who then appeared on the
scene had recourse to high-sounding words and phrases,
as well as to latinized constructions by which they
hoped to elevate their style. The grand style of
“Paradise Lost” was bound to suffer severely at the
hands of imitators, and there can be little doubt but
that much of the preposterous latinizing of the time
is to be traced to this cause. At the same time the
influence of the general literary tendencies of the
Augustan ages is not to be ignored in this connexion.
When a diction freely sprinkled with latinized terms
is found used by writers like Thomson in the first
quarter, and Cowper at the end of the century, it may
perhaps also be regarded as a mannerism of style due
in some degree to influences which were still powerful
enough to affect literary workmanship. For it must
be remembered that in the eighteenth century the
traditional supremacy of Latin had not yet altogether
died out: pulpit and forensic eloquence, as well as
the great prose works of the period, still bore abundant
traces of the persistency of this influence.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Hence
it need not be at all surprising to find that it has
invaded poetry. The use of latinized words and
phrases gave, or was supposed to give, an air of culture
to verse, and contemporary readers did not always,
we may suppose, regard such language as a mere
display of pedantry.</p>

<p>In this, as in other respects of the poetic output of
the period, we may see a further reflex of the general
literary atmosphere of the first half or so of the
eighteenth century. There was no poetry of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
highest rank, and not a great deal of <i>poetical</i> poetry;
the bulk of the output is “poetry without an atmosphere.”
The very qualities most admired in prose—lucidity,
correctness, absence of “enthusiasm”—were
such as were approved for poetry; even the
Romantic forerunners, with perhaps the single exception
of Blake, felt the pressure of the prosaic atmosphere
of their times. No doubt had a poet of the
highest order appeared he would have swept away
much of the accumulated rubbish and fashioned for
himself a new poetic language, as Thomson tried, and
Wordsworth later thought to do. But he did not
appear, and the vast majority of the practitioners
were content to ring the changes on the material they
found at hand, and were not likely to dream of anything
different.</p>

<p>It is thus not sufficient to say that the “rapid and
almost simultaneous diffusion of this purely cutaneous
eruption,” to borrow an appropriate description from
Lowell, was due solely to the potent influence of
Milton. It reflects also the average conception of
poetry held throughout a good part of the eighteenth
century, a conception which led writers to seek in
mere words qualities which are to be found in them
only when they are the reflex of profound thought or
powerful emotion. In short, latinism in eighteenth
century poetry may be regarded as a literary fashion,
akin in nature to the stock epithets and phrases of the
“descriptive” poetry, which were later to be unsparingly
condemned as the typical eighteenth century
poetical diction.</p>

<p>Of the poetic value of these latinized words little
need be said. Whether or no they reflect a conscious
effort to extend, enrich, or renew the vocabulary of
English poetry, they cannot be said to have added
much to the expressive resources of the language.
This is not, of course, merely because they are of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
direct Latin origin. We know that around the central
Teutonic core of English there have slowly been built
up two mighty strata of Latin and Romance formations,
which, in virtue of their long employment by
writers in prose and verse, as well as on the lips of the
people, have slowly acquired that force and picturesqueness
which the poet needs for his purpose.
But the latinized words of the eighteenth century are
on a different footing. To us, nowadays, there is
something pretentious and pedantic about them:
they are artificial formations or adoptions, and not
living words. English poets from time to time have
been able to give a poetical colouring to such words,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
and the eighteenth century is not without happy
instances of this power. James Thomson here and
there wins real poetic effects from his latinized vocabulary,
as in such a passage as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here lofty trees to ancient song unknown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble sons of potent heat and floods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prone-rushing from the clouds, rear high to heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their thorny stems, and broad around them throw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meridian gloom.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 653 foll.)<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The “return to Nature,” of which Thomson was
perhaps the most noteworthy pioneer, brought back
all the sights and sounds of outdoor life as subjects
fit and meet for the poet’s song, and it is therefore of
some interest, in the present connexion, to note that
Wordsworth himself, who also knew how to make
excellent use of high-sounding Latin formations,
has perhaps nowhere illustrated this faculty better
than in the famous passage on the Yew Trees of
Borrowdale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Those fraternal Four of Borrowdale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joined in one solemn and capacious grove:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Huge trunks! and each particular trunk a growth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of intertwisted fibres serpentine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upcoiling, and inveterately convolved;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor uninformed with Phantasy, and looks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That threaten the profane.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the bulk of eighteenth century latinisms fall
within a different category; rarely do they convey,
either in themselves or in virtue of their context, any
of that mysterious power of association which constitutes
the poetic value of words and enables the
writer, whether in prose or verse, to convey to his
reader delicate shades of meaning and suggestion
which are immediately recognized and appreciated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">ARCHAISM IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>One of the earliest and most significant of those
literary manifestations which were to culminate
in the triumph of Romanticism was a new
enkindled interest in the older English writers. The
attitude of the great body of the so-called “Classicists”
towards the earlier English poetry was not
altogether one of absolute contempt: it was rather
marked by that indifference which is the outcome
of ignorance. Readers and authors, with certain
illustrious exceptions, were totally unacquainted with
Chaucer, and though Spenser fared better, even those
who did know him did not at first consider him worthy
of serious study.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Yet the Romantic rebels, by their
attempts to imitate Spenser, and to reveal his poetic
genius to a generation of unbelievers, did work of
immediate and lasting value.</p>

<p>It is perhaps too much to claim that some dim
perception of the poetic value of old words contributed
in any marked degree to this Spenserian revival
in the eighteenth century. Yet it can hardly be
doubted that Spenser’s language, imperfectly understood
and at first considered “barbarous,” or
“Gothic,” or at best merely “quaint,” came ultimately
to be regarded as supplying something of that
atmosphere of “old romance” which was beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to captivate the hearts and minds of men. This is
not to say that there was any conscious or deliberate
intention of freshening or revivifying poetic language
by an infusion of old or “revived” words. But the
Spenserian and similar imitations naturally involved
the use of such words, and they thus made an important
contribution to the Romantic movement on its
purely formal side; they played their part in destroying
the pseudo-classical heresy that the best, indeed
the only, medium for poetic expression was the
polished idiom of Pope and his school.</p>

<p>The poets and critics of Western Europe, who, as
we have seen, in the sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries had busied themselves with the question
of refining and embellishing their mother tongue,
had advocated among other means the revival of
archaic and obsolete words. Spenser himself, we
know, had definitely adopted this means in the
“Shepherds Kalendar,” though the method of increasing
his poetical vocabulary had not been approved
by all of his contemporaries and successors. Milton,
when forming the special poetical language he needed
for his immense task, confined himself largely to
“classical” coinages, and his archaisms, such as <i>swinkt</i>,
<i>rathe</i>, <i>nathless</i>, <i>frore</i>, are comparatively few in number.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Dryden’s attitude towards old words was stated
with his customary good sense, and though his
modernization of Chaucer gave him endless opportunities
of experimenting with them, he never abused
the advantage, and indeed in all his work there is but
little trace of the deliberate revival of obsolete or
archaic words. In the “Fables” may be found a few
words such as <i>sounded</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> (swounded) which had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
used by Malory and Spenser, <i>laund</i> for (lawn), <i>rushed</i>
(cut-off), etc., and he has also Milton’s <i>rathe</i>. Dryden,
however, is found using a large number of terms
which were evidently obsolete in the literary language,
but which, it may be supposed, still lingered in the
spoken language, and especially in the provincial
dialects. He is fond of the word <i>ken</i> (to know), and
amongst other examples are <i>stead</i> (place), <i>to lease</i>
(glean), <i>shent</i> (rebuked), <i>hattered</i> (worn out), <i>dorp</i> (a
village), <i>buries</i> (burrows), etc. Dryden is also
apparently responsible for the poetic use of the term
“<i>doddered</i>,” a word of somewhat uncertain meaning,
which, after his time and following his practice, came
into common use as an epithet for old oaks, and,
rarely, for other trees.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>As might be expected, there are few traces of the
use of obsolete or archaic words in the works of Pope.
The “correct” style did not favour innovations in
language, whether they consisted in the formation of
new words or in the revival of old forms. Pope
stated in a letter to Hughes, who edited Spenser’s
works (1715), that “Spenser has been ever a favourite
poet to me,”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> but among the imitations “done by
the Author in his Youth,” there is “The Alley,” a
very coarse parody of Spenser, which does not point
to any real appreciation or understanding on the part
of Pope. In the first book of the “Dunciad” as we
have seen, he indulged in a fling at the antiquaries,
especially Hearne and those who took pleasure in our
older literature, by means of a satiric stanza written
in a pseudo-archaic language.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> But his language
is much freer than that of Dryden from archaisms or
provincialisms. He has forms like <i>gotten</i>, <i>whelm</i> (overwhelm),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
<i>rampires</i> (ramparts), <i>swarths</i>, <i>catched</i> (caught),
<i>thrice-ear’d</i> (ploughed), etc. Neither Dryden nor
Pope, it may be said, would ever have dreamed of
reviving an archaic word simply because it was an
old word, and therefore to be regarded as “poetical.”
To imagine this is to attribute to the seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries a state of feeling which
is essentially modern, and which lends a glamour to
old and almost forgotten words. Dryden would accept
any word which he considered suitable for his purpose,
but he always insisted that old words had to prove
their utility, and that they had otherwise no claim
to admission to the current vocabulary. Pope, however,
we may suspect, would not admit any words
not immediately intelligible to his readers, or requiring
a footnote to explain them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the year 1715, there had appeared the
first attempt to give a critical text of Spenser, when
John Hughes published his edition of the poet’s works
in six volumes, together with a biography, a glossary,
and some critical remarks.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The obsolete terms which
Hughes felt himself obliged to explain<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> include many,
such as <i>aghast</i>, <i>baleful</i>, <i>behest</i>, <i>bootless</i>, <i>carol</i>, <i>craven</i>,
<i>dreary</i>, <i>forlorn</i>, <i>foray</i>, <i>guerdon</i>, <i>plight</i>, <i>welkin</i>, <i>yore</i>,
which are now for the most part familiar words,
though forty years later Thomas Warton in his
“Observations on The Faerie Queene” (1754) is found
annotating many similar terms. The well-known
“Muses’ Library,” published thirteen years previously,
had described itself as “A General Collection
of almost all the old and valuable poetry extant, now
so industriously inquir’d after”; it begins with
Langland and reflects the renewed interest that was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
arising in the older poets. But there is as yet little
evidence of any general and genuine appreciation of
either the spirit or the form of the best of the
earlier English poetry. The Spenserian imitators
undoubtedly felt that their diction must look so obsolete
and archaic as to call for a glossary of explanation,
and these glossaries were often more than necessary,
not only to explain the genuine old words, but also
because of the fact that in many cases the supposedly
“Spenserian” terms were spurious coinages devoid
of any real meaning at all.</p>

<p>Before considering these Spenserian imitations it
must not be forgotten that there were, prior to these
attempts and alongside of them, kindred efforts to
catch the manner and style of Chaucer. This practice
received its first great impulse from Dryden’s famous
essay in praise of Chaucer, and the various periodicals
and miscellanies of the first half of the eighteenth
century bear witness to the fact that many eminent
poets, not to mention a crowd of poetasters, thought
it their duty to publish a poetical tribute couched in
the supposed language and manner of Chaucer.</p>

<p>These attempts were nearly all avowedly humorous,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and seemed based on a belief that the very language
of Chaucer was in some respects suitable comic material
for a would-be humorous writer. Such an attitude
was obviously the outcome of a not unnatural ignorance
of the historical development of the language.
Chaucer’s language had long been regarded as almost
a dead language, and this attitude had persisted even
to the eighteenth century, so that it was felt that a
mastery of the language of the “Canterbury Tales”
required prolonged study. Even Thomas Warton,
speaking of Chaucer, was of the opinion that “his
uncouth and unfamiliar language disgusts and deters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
many readers.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Hence it is not surprising that there
was a complete failure to catch, not only anything of
the real spirit of Chaucer, but also anything that
could be described as even a distant approach to his
language. The imitators seemed to think that fourteenth
century English could be imitated by the use
of common words written in an uncommon way, or
of strange terms with equally strange meanings. The
result was an artificial language that could never have
been spoken by anybody, often including words to
which it is impossible to give any definite sense. It
would seem that only two genuine Chaucerian terms
had really been properly grasped, and this pair, ne
and eke, is in consequence worked to death. Ignorance
of the earlier language naturally led to spurious grammatical
forms, of which the most favoured was a
singular verb form ending in -<i>en</i>. Gay, for instance,
has, in a poem of seventeen lines, such phrases as “It
maken doleful song,” “There <i>spreaden</i> a rumour,”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
whilst Fenton writes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If in mine quest thou <i>falsen</i> me.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The general style and manner of these imitations, with
their “humorous” tinge, their halting verse, bad
grammar, and impossible inflections are well illustrated
in William Thompson’s “Garden Inscription—Written
in Chaucer’s Bowre,” though more serious efforts were
not any more successful.</p>

<p>The death of Pope, strangely enough, called forth
more than one attempt, among them being Thomas
Warton’s imitation of the characterization of the birds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
from the “Parliament of Fowles.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Better known at
the time was the monody “Musæus,” written by
William Mason, “To the memory of Mr. Pope.”
Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton are represented as
coming to mourn the inevitable loss of him who was
about to die, and Mason endeavoured to reproduce
their respective styles, “Tityrus” (Chaucer) holding
forth in this strain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mickle of wele betide thy houres last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For mich gode wirke to me don and past.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For syn the days whereas my lyre ben strongen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And deftly many a mery laie I songen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Time which alle things don maliciously,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gnawen with rusty tooth continually,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grattrid my lines, that they all cancrid ben</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till at the last thou smoothen hem hast again.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is astonishing to think that this mechanical imitation,
with its harsh and forced rhythm, and its almost
doggerel language, was regarded at the time as a
successful reproduction of Chaucer’s manner and
style. But probably before 1775, when Tyrwhitt
announced his rediscovery of the secret of Chaucer’s
rhythm, few eighteenth century readers suspected its
presence at all.</p>

<p>But the Chaucerian imitations were merely a literary
fashion predoomed to failure. It was not in any way
the result of a genuine influence of the early English
poetry on contemporary taste, and thus it was not
even vitalized, as was the Spenserian revival, by a
certain vague and undefined desire to catch something
at least of the spirit of the “Faerie Queene.”
The Spenserian imitations had a firmer foundation,
and because the best of them did not confine their
ambition altogether to the mechanical imitation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Spenser’s style in the narrower sense they achieved
a greater measure of success.</p>

<p>It is significant to note that among the first attempts
at a Spenserian imitation was that made by one of the
foremost of the Augustans. This was Matthew Prior,
who in 1706 published his “Ode, Humbly Inscribed
to the Queen on the Glorious success of Her Majesty’s
Arms, Written in Imitation of Spenser’s Style.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
We are surprised, however, to find when we have read
his Preface, that Prior’s aim was in reality to write a
poem on the model of Horace and of Spenser. The
attitude in which he approached Spenser’s language is
made quite clear by his explanation. He has “avoided
such of his words as I found too obsolete. I have
however retained some few of them to make the
colouring look more like Spenser’s.” Follows then a
list of such words, including “<i>behest</i>, command; <i>band</i>,
army; <i>prowess</i>, strength; <i>I weet</i>, I know; <i>I ween</i>,
I think; <i>whilom</i>, heretofore; and two or three more
of that kind.” Though later in his Preface Prior
speaks of the <i>curiosa felicitas</i> of Spenser’s diction, it
is evident that there is little or no real understanding
or appreciation.</p>

<p>Now began a continuous series of Spenserian imitations,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
of which, with a few exceptions, the only
distinguishing characteristic was a small vocabulary
of obsolete words, upon which the poetasters could
draw for the “local colour” considered necessary.
In the majority of cases the result was a purely artificial
language, probably picked haphazard from the
“Faerie Queene,” and often used without any definite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
idea of its meaning or appropriateness.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Fortunately,
one or two real poets were attracted by the idea, and
in due course produced their “imitations.”</p>

<p>William Shenstone (1714-1763) is perhaps worthy
of being ranked amongst these, in virtue at least of
“The Schoolmistress,” which appeared in its final
shape in 1742. Shenstone himself confesses that the
poem was not at first intended to be a serious imitation,
but his study of Spenser led him gradually to something
like a real appreciation of the earlier poet.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>“The Schoolmistress” draws upon the usual
common stock of old words: <i>whilom</i>, <i>mickle</i>, <i>perdie</i>,
<i>eke</i>, <i>thik</i>, etc., but often, as in the case of Spenser
himself, the obsolete terms have a playful and
humorous effect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For they in gaping wonderment abound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And think, no doubt, she been the greatest wight on ground.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor is there lacking a quaint, wistful tenderness, as
in the description of the refractory schoolboy, who,
after being flogged,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Behind some door, in melancholy thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mindless of food, he, dreary caitiff, pines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne for his fellows joyaunce careth aught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to the wind all merriment resigns.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Hence “The Schoolmistress” is no mere parody or
imitation: there is a real and tender humanity in the
description of the village school (adumbrating, it
would seem, Goldsmith’s efforts with a similar theme),
whilst the judicious use of Spenser’s stanza and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
sprinkling of his old words help to invest the whole
poem with an atmosphere of genuine and unaffected
humour.</p>

<p>The next Spenserian whose work merits attention
is William Thompson, who, it would seem, had delved
not a little into the Earlier English poetry, and who was
one of the first to capture something of the real atmosphere
of the “Faerie Queene.” His “Epithalamium”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
and “The Nativity,”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> which appeared in 1736, are
certainly among the best of the imitations. It is
important to note that, while there is a free use of
supposedly archaic words, with the usual list of <i>certes</i>,
<i>perdie</i>, <i>sikerly</i>, <i>hight</i>, as well as others less common,
such as <i>belgards</i> (“beautiful looks”), <i>bonnibel</i> (“beautiful
virgin”), there is no abuse of the practice. Not a
little of the genuine spirit of Spenser’s poetry, with its
love of nature and outdoor life, has been caught and
rendered without any lavish recourse to an artificial
and mechanical diction, as a stanza from “The
Nativity,” despite its false rhymes, will perhaps show:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eftsoons he spied a grove, the Season’s pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All in the centre of a pleasant glade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Nature flourished like a virgin bride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Mantled with green, with hyacinths inlaid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And crystal-rills o’er beds of lilies stray’d:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blue-ey’d violet and King-cup gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And new blown roses, smiling sweetly red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out-glow’d the blushing infancy of Day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While amorous west-winds kist their fragrant souls away.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This cannot altogether be said of the “Hymn to
May” published over twenty years later,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> despite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the fact that Thompson himself draws attention to
the fact that he does not consider that a genuine
Spenserian imitation may be produced by scattering
a certain number of obsolete words through the poem.
Nevertheless, we find that he has sprinkled his
“Hymn” plentifully with “obsolete” terms, though
they include a few, such as <i>purfled</i>, <i>dispredden</i>, <i>goodlihead</i>,
that were not the common property of the
poetasters. His explanations of the words so used
show that not a few of them were used with little
knowledge of their original meaning, as when he
defines <i>glen</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> as “a country hamlet,” or explains
<i>perdie</i> as “an old word for saying anything.” It is
obvious also that many obsolete terms are often simply
stuck in the lines when their more modern equivalents
would have served equally well, as for instance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Full suddenly the seeds of joy <i>recure</i> (“recover”),</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Myrtles to Venus <i>algates</i> sacred been.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">With these reservations the diction of Thompson’s
poems is pure and unaffected, and the occasional
happy use of archaism is well illustrated in more than
one stanza of “The Nativity.”</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that the best of all the
Spenserian imitations is “The Castle of Indolence,”
which James Thomson published two months before
his death in 1748.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Yet even in this case there is
evident a sort of quiet condescension, as if it were in
Thompson’s mind that he was about to draw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
attention of his eighteenth century audience to something
quaint and old-fashioned, but which had yet
a charm of its own. “The obsolete words,” he writes
in his “advertisement” to the poem, “and a simplicity
of diction in some of the lines, which borders
on the ludicrous, were necessary to make the imitation
more perfect.” Hence he makes use of a number of
words intended to give an archaic air to his poem,
including the usual <i>certes</i>, <i>withouten</i>, <i>sheen</i>, <i>perdie,</i>
<i>weet</i>, <i>pleasaunce</i>, <i>ycleped</i>, etc. To the first edition
was appended a page of explanation of these and
other “obsolete words used in this poem”: altogether
between seventy and eighty such words are thus
glossed, the large majority of which are familiar
enough nowadays, either as part of the ordinary
vocabulary, or as belonging especially to the diction
of poetry.</p>

<p>Though the archaisms are sometimes scattered in a
haphazard manner, they are not used with such
mechanical monotony as is obvious in the bulk of the
Spenserian imitations. In both cantos there are
long stretches without a single real or pseudo-archaism,
and indeed, when Thomson is indulging in one of the
moral or the didactic surveys characteristic of his
age, as, for instance, when the bard, invoked by
Sir Industry, breaks into a long tirade on the Supreme
Perfection (Canto II, 47-61) his diction is the plain
and unadorned idiom perfected by Pope.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Yet
Thompson occasionally yields to the fascination of
the spurious form in <i>-en</i>,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Sometimes it would seem that his archaisms owe their

<p class="noindent">But, on the whole, he has been successful in his efforts,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Though the Spenserian imitations continued beyond
the year which saw the birth of Wordsworth,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> it is
not necessary to mention further examples, except
perhaps that of William Mickle, who, in 1767, published
“The Concubine,” a Spenserian imitation of two
cantos, which afterwards appeared in a later edition
(1777) under the title “Sir Martyn.” Like his predecessors,
Mickle made free use of obsolete spellings
and words, while he added the usual glossary, which
is significant as showing at the end of the eighteenth
century, about the time when Tyrwhitt was completing
his edition of Chaucer, not only the artificial
character of this “Spenserian diction,” but also the
small acquaintance of the average man of letters with
our earlier language.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>It must not be assumed, of course, that all the
“obsolete” words used by the imitators were taken
directly from Spenser. Words like <i>nathless</i>, <i>rathe</i>,
<i>hight</i>, <i>sicker</i>, <i>areeds</i>, <i>cleeped</i>, <i>hardiment</i>, <i>felly</i>, etc., had
continued in fairly common use until the seventeenth
century, though actually some of them were regarded
even then as archaisms. Thus <i>cleoped</i>, though never
really obsolete, is marked by Blount in 1656 as
“Saxon”; <i>sicker</i>, extensively employed in Middle
English, is rarely found used after 1500 except by
Scotch writers, though it still remains current in
northern dialects. On the other hand, not a few words
were undoubtedly brought directly back into literature
from the pages of Spenser, among them being <i>meed</i>,
<i>sheen</i> (boasting an illustrious descent from <i>Beowulf</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
through Chaucer), <i>erst</i>, <i>elfin</i>, <i>paramour</i>. Others, like
<i>scrannel</i>, and apparently also <i>ledded</i>, were made
familiar by Milton’s use the former either being the
poet’s own coinage or his borrowing from some dialect
or other. On the other hand, very many of the
“revived” words failed to take root at all, such as
<i>faitours</i>, which Spenser himself had apparently revived,
and also his coinage <i>singult</i>, though Scott is found
using the latter form.</p>

<p>As has been said, the crowd of poetasters who
attempted to reproduce Spenser’s spirit and style
thought to do so by merely mechanical imitation of
what they regarded as his “quaint” or “ludicrous”
diction. Between them and any possibility of grasping
the perennial beauty and charm of the “poet’s poet”
there was a great gulf fixed, whilst, altogether apart
from this fatal limitation, then parodies were little
likely to have even ephemeral success, for parody
presupposes in its readers at least a little knowledge
and appreciation of the thing parodied. But there
were amongst the imitators one or two at least who,
we may imagine, were able to find in the melody and
romance of “The Faerie Queene” an avenue of
escape from the prosaic pressure of their times. In
the case of William Thompson, Shenstone, and the
author of the “Castle of Indolence,” the influence of
Spenser revealed itself as in integral and vital part of
the Romantic reaction, for these, being real poets,
had been able to recapture something at least of the
colour, music, and fragrance of their original. And
not only did these, helped by others whose names have
all but been forgotten restore a noble stanza form to
English verse. Even their mechanical imitation of
Spenser’s language was not without its influence, for
it cannot be doubted that these attempts to write in
an archaic or pseudo-archaic style did not a little to free
poetry from the shackles of a conventional language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>This process was greatly helped by that other
aspect of the eighteenth century revival of the past
which was exemplified in the publication of numerous
collections of old ballads and songs.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> There is, of
course, as Macaulay long ago noted, a series of conventional
epithets that is one mark of the genuine
ballad manner, but the true ballad language was not
a lifeless stereotyped diction. It consisted of “plain
English without any trimmings.” The ballads had
certain popular mannerisms (<i>the good greenwood</i>, <i>the
wan water</i>, etc.), but they were free from the conventional
figures of speech, or such rhetorical artifices
as personification and periphrasis.</p>

<p>Hence it is not surprising that at first their fresh
and spontaneous language was regarded, when contrasted
with the artificial and refined diction of the
time, as “barbarous” or “rude.” Thus Prior
thought it necessary to paraphrase the old ballad of
the “Nut Brown Maid” into his insipid “Henry and
Emma” (1718), but a comparison of only a few lines
of the original with the banality of the modernized
version is sufficient testimony to the refreshing
and vivifying influence of such collections as the
“Reliques.”</p>

<p>The tendency to present the old ballads in an
eighteenth century dress had soon revealed itself;
at least, the editors of the early collections often felt
themselves obliged to apologize for the obsolete style
of their material.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But in 1760 the first attempt
at a critical text appeared when Edward Capell,
the famous Shakespearian editor, published his
“Prolusions”; or “Select Pieces of Antient Poetry—compil’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
with great Care from their several Originals,
and offer’d to the Publick as specimens of the Integrity
that should be found in the Editions of worthy
Authors.” Capell’s care was almost entirely directed
to ensuring textual accuracy, but the “Nut-Browne
Maid,” the only ballad included, receives sympathetic
mention in his brief <i>Preface</i>.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Five years later, the most famous of all the ballad
collections appeared, Thomas Percy’s “Reliques of
Ancient English Poetry” (1765). The nucleus of
Percy’s collection was a certain manuscript in a
handwriting of Charles I’s time, containing 191 songs
and ballads, but he had also had access to various
other manuscript collections, whilst he was quite
ready to acknowledge that he had filled gaps in his
originals with stanzas and, in some cases, with nearly
entire poems of his own composition. Much censure
has been heaped upon Percy for his apparent lax
ideas on the functions of an editor, but in decking out
his “parcel of old ballads” in the false and affected
style of his age, he was only doing his best to meet
the taste of his readers. He himself passes judgment
on his own labours, when, alongside of the genuine
old ballads, with their freshness and simplicity of
diction, he places his own “pruned” or “refined”
versions, or additions, garbed in a sham and sickly
idiom.</p>

<p>It was not until over a century later, when Percy’s
folio manuscript was copied and printed,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> that the
extent of his additions, alterations, and omissions
were fully realized, though at the same time it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
admitted that the pruning and refining was not
unskilfully done.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the influence of the “Reliques,” as
a vital part of the Romantic revival, was considerable:<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
it was as if a breath of “the wind on the heath” had
swept across literature and its writers, bringing with
it an invigorating fragrance and freshness, whilst, on
the purely formal side, the genuine old ballads, which
Percy had culled and printed untouched, no doubt
played their part in directing the attention of Wordsworth
to the whole question of the language of poetry.
And when the great Romantic manifestoes on the
subject of “the language of metrical composition”
were at length launched, their author was not slow to
bear witness to the revivifying influence of the old
ballads on poetic form. “Our poetry,” he wrote,
“has been absolutely redeemed by it. I do not
think that there is an able writer in verse of the
present day who would not be proud to acknowledge
his obligations to the “Reliques.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>The year before the appearance of the “Reliques,”
Thomas Chatterton had published his “Rowley
Poems,” and this attempt of a poet of genius to pass
off his poems as the work of a mediaeval English
writer is another striking indication of the new
Romantic spirit then asserting itself. As for the
pseudo-archaic language in which Chatterton with
great labour clothed his “revivals,” there is no need
to say much. It was a thoroughly artificial language,
compiled, as Skeat has shown, from various sources,
such as John Kersey’s “Dictionarium Anglo-Brittanicum,”
three editions of which had appeared before
1721. In this work there are included a considerable
number of obsolete words, chiefly from Spenser and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
his contemporaries, marked “O,” and in some cases
erroneously explained. This dictionary was the chief
source of Chatterton’s vocabulary, many words of
which the young poet took apparently without any
definite idea of their meaning.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Yet in the Rowley poems there are passages where
the pseudo-archaic language is quite in keeping with
the poet’s theme and treatment, whilst here and there
we come across epithets and lines which, even in their
strange dress, are of a wild and artless sweetness,
such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where thou mayst here the sweete night-lark chant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or with some mocking brooklet sweetly glide,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the whole of the first stanza of the famous “An
Excelente Balade of Charitie,” where the old words
help to transport us at once into the fictitious world
which Chatterton had made for himself. Perhaps,
as has been suggested, the “Rowley dialect” was not,
as we nowadays, with Skeat’s analysis in our minds,
are a little too apt to believe, a deliberate attempt to
deceive, but rather reflected an attempt to escape
from the dead abstract diction of the period.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Apart from this special aspect of the Romantic
revival marked by a tendency to look back lovingly
to the earlier English poetry, there are few traces of
the use of archaic and obsolete words, at least of such
words used consciously, in eighteenth century poetry.
The great poets of the century make little or no use
of them. Collins has no examples, but Gray, who
began by advocating the poet’s right to use obsolete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
words, and later seemed to recant, now and then uses
an old term, as when in his translation from Dante
he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The anguish that unuttered <i>nathless</i> wrings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My inmost heart.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Blake, however, it is interesting to note, often used
archaic forms, or at least archaic spellings,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> as <i>Tyger</i>,
<i>antient</i> (“To the Muses”), “the <i>desart</i> wild” (“The
Little Girl Lost”), as well as such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In lucent words my darkling verses dight</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Imitation of Spenser”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So I piped with merry <i>chear</i>.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(Introduction to “Songs of Innocence”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Perhaps by these means the poet wished to give a
quaint or old-fashioned look to his verses, though it
is to be remembered that most of them occur in the
“Poetical Sketches,” which are avowedly Elizabethan.</p>

<p>The use of archaic and obsolete words in the
eighteenth century was then chiefly an outcome of
that revival of the past which was one of the characteristics
of the new Romantic movement, and which
was later to find its culmination in the works of Scott.
The old words used by the eighteenth century
imitators of Spenser were not often used, we may
imagine, because poets saw in them poetical beauty
and value; most often they were the result of a desire
to catch, as it were, something of the “local colour”
of the “Faerie Queene,” just as modern writers nowadays,
poets and novelists alike, often draw upon local
dialects for new means of expression. The Spenserian
imitations recovered not a few words, such as <i>meed</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
<i>sheen</i>, <i>dight</i>, <i>glen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> which have since been regarded as
belonging especially to the diction of poetry, and
when the Romantic revival had burst into life the
impulse, which had thus been unconsciously given,
was continued by some of its great leaders. Scott, as
is well known, was an enthusiastic lover of our older
literature, especially the ballads, from which he
gleaned many words full of a beauty and charm
which won for them immediate admission into the
language of poetry; at the same time he was able to
find many similar words in the local dialects of the
lowlands and the border. Perhaps in this work he
had been inspired by his famous countryman, Robert
Burns, who by his genius had raised his native language,
with its stores of old and vivid words and expressions,
to classical rank.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless it is undoubted that the main factor
in the new Romantic attitude towards old words had
been the eighteenth century imitations and collections
of our older English literature. Coleridge, it is to be
remembered, made free use of archaisms; in the
“Ancient Mariner,” there are many obsolete forms:
<i>loon</i>, <i>eftsoons</i>, <i>uprist</i>, <i>gramercy</i>, <i>gossameres</i>, <i>corse</i>, etc.,
besides those which appeared in the first edition, and
were altered or omitted when the poem reappeared in
1800. Wordsworth, it is true, made no use of archaic
diction, whether in the form of deliberate revivals, or
by drafts on the dialects, which, following the great
example of Burns, and in virtue of his own “theories,”
he might have been expected to explore. Nevertheless
the “theories” concerning poetical language
which he propounded and maintained are not without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
their bearing on the present question. Reduced to
their simplest terms, the manifestoes, while passing
judgment on the conventional poetical diction, conceded
to the poet the right of a style in keeping with his
subject and inspiration, and Wordsworth’s successors
for the most part, so far as style in the narrower sense
of <i>vocabulary</i> is concerned, did not fail to reap the
benefits of the emancipation won for them. And
among the varied sources upon which they began to
draw for fresh reserves of diction were the abundant
stores of old words, full of colour and energy, to be
gleaned from the pages of their great predecessors.</p>

<span class="smaller">COMPOUND EPITHETS IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is proposed in this chapter to examine in some
detail the use of compound epithets in the poetry
of the eighteenth century. For this purpose the
following grammatical scheme of classification has
been adopted from various sources:<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> <i>First Type</i>,
noun <i>plus</i> noun; <i>Second Type</i>, noun <i>plus</i> adjective;
<i>Third Type</i>, noun <i>plus</i> present participle; <i>Fourth
Type</i>, noun <i>plus</i> past participle; <i>Fifth Type</i>, adjective,
or adjective used adverbially, <i>plus</i> another part of
speech, usually a participle; <i>Sixth Type</i>, true adverb
<i>plus</i> a participle; <i>Seventh Type</i>, adjective <i>plus</i> noun
plus -<i>ed</i>. Of these types it will be evident in many
cases that the first (noun <i>plus</i> noun) and the sixth
(true adverb <i>plus</i> participle) are not compounds at all,
for the hyphen could often be removed without any
change or loss of meaning. Occasionally the compounds
will be regarded from the point of view of the
logical relation between the two elements, when a
formal classification may usually be made as follows:
(<i>a</i>) <i>Attributive</i>, as in “anger-glow”; (<i>b</i>) <i>Objective</i>, as
in “anger-kindling”; (<i>c</i>) <i>Instrumental</i>, as in “anger-boiling.”
This scheme of classification permits of an
examination of the compounds from the formal point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
of view, whilst at the same time it does not preclude
an estimate of the æsthetic value of the new words
thus added to the language of poetry.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>It may be said, to begin with, that the formation
and use of compound epithets has always been one
of the distinguishing marks of the special language
of poetry in English, as distinct from that of prose.
The very ease with which they can be formed out of
the almost inexhaustible resources of the English
vocabulary has been a constant source of temptation
to poets with new things to say, or new impressions
to describe. Moreover, the partial disappearance of
inflections in modern English has permitted of a
vagueness in the formation of compound words,
which in itself is of value to the word-maker. Though,
of course, it is possible in most cases accurately to
analyse the logical relation between the elements of a
compound, yet it sometimes happens, especially with
the compound epithets of poetry, that this cannot
be done with certainty, because the new formation
may have been the result of a hasty but happy inspiration,
with no regard to the regular rules of composition.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Hence, from one point of view, the free formation of
compounds is a legitimate device allowed to the
poets, of which the more severe atmosphere of prose is
expected to take less advantage; from another point
of view, the greater prevalence of the compound in
poetry may not be unconnected with the rhythm of
verse. Viewed in this light, the use of compound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
epithets in our poetry at any period may well have
been conditioned, in part at least, by the metrical
form in which that poetry received expression; and
thus in the poetry of the eighteenth century it connects
itself in some degree—first, with the supremacy of
the heroic couplet, and later with the blank
verse that proved to be the chief rival of the
decasyllabic.</p>

<p>The freedom of construction which facilitates the
formation of compounds had already in the earliest
English period contributed to that special poetic
diction which is a distinguishing mark of Anglo-Saxon
verse, as indeed of all the old Germanic poetry;
of the large number of words not used in Anglo-Saxon
prose, very many are synonymous compounds
meaning the same thing.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> During the Middle English
period, and especially before the triumph of the East
Midland dialect definitely prepared the way for
Modern English, it would seem that the language lost
much of its old power of forming compounds, one
explanation being that the large number of French
words, which then came into the language, drove out
many of the Old English compounds, whilst at the
same time these in-comers, so easily acquired, tended
to discourage the formation of new compounds.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
It was not until the great outburst of literary activity
in the second half of the sixteenth century that a
fresh impetus was given to the formation of compound
nouns and epithets. The large number of classical
translations especially exercised an important influence
in this respect: each new translation had its quota
of fresh compounds, but Chapman’s “Homer” may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
be mentioned as especially noteworthy.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> At the same
time the plastic state of Elizabethan English led to
the making of expressive new compounds of native
growth, and from this period date some of the happiest
compound epithets to be found in the language.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
From the Elizabethans this gift of forming imaginative
compounds was inherited, with even greater felicity
by Milton, many of whose epithets, especially those
of Type VII such as “<i>grey-hooded even</i>,” “<i>coral-paven
floor</i>,” “<i>flowery-kirtled</i> Naiades” reveal him
as a consummate master of word-craft.</p>

<p>With Dryden begins the period with which we are
especially concerned, for it is generally agreed that
from nearly every point of view the advent of what is
called eighteenth century literature dates from the
Restoration. During the forty years dominated by
Dryden in practically every department of literature,
the changes in the language, both of prose and poetry,
which had been slowly evolving themselves, became
apparent, and, as the sequel will show, this new ideal
of style, with its passion for “correctness,” and its
impatience of innovation, was not one likely to
encourage or inspire the formation of expressive
compounds; the happy audacities of the Elizabethans,
of whose tribe it is customary to seal Milton, are no
longer possible.</p>

<p>The compounds in the poems of Dryden show this;
of his examples of Type I—the substantive compounds—the
majority are merely the juxtaposition
of two appositional nouns, as <i>brother-angels</i> (“Killigrew,”
4); or, more rarely, where the first element
has a descriptive or adjectival force, as <i>traitor-friend</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
(“Palamon,” II, 568). Not much more imaginative
power is reflected in Dryden’s compound epithets;
his instances of Types III and IV include “<i>cloud-dispelling</i>
winds” (“Ovid,” Met. I, 356), “<i>sun-begotten</i>
tribe” (<i>ibid.</i>, III, 462), with more original
examples like “<i>sleep-procuring</i> wand.” Next comes
a large number of instances of Types V and VI:
“<i>thick-spread</i> forest” (“Palamon,” II, 123), “<i>hoarse-resounding</i>
shore” (“Iliad” I, 54), as well as many
compounded with <i>long</i>-, <i>well</i>-, <i>high</i>-, etc. Most of
these examples of Types V and VI are scarcely compounds
at all, for after such elements as “long,”
“well,” “much,” the hyphen could in most cases
be omitted without any loss of power. Of Dryden’s
compound epithets it may be said in general that they
reflect admirably his poetic theory and practice;
they are never the product of a “fine frenzy.” At the
same time not a few of them seem to have something
of that genius for satirical expression with which he
was amply endowed. Compounds like <i>court-informer</i>
(“Absalom,” 719), “the rebels’ <i>pension-purse</i>” (<i>ibid.</i>,
Pt. II, 321),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">play their part in the delivery of those “smacks in
the face” of which Professor Saintsbury speaks
in his discussion of Dryden’s satiric manipulation of
the heroic couplet.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In the verse of Pope, compound formations are to be
found in large numbers. This may partly be attributed,
no doubt, to the amount of translation included
in it, but even in his original poetry there are many
more instances than in the work of his great predecessor.
When engaged on his translation of Homer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the prevalence of compounds naturally attracted his
attention, and he refers to the matter more than once
in his Preface.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> As might be expected from the
apostle of “correctness,” he lays down cautious and
conservative “rules” of procedure. Such should be
retained “as slide easily of themselves into an English
compound, without violence to the ear, or to the
received rules of composition, as well as those which
have received the sanction from the authority of our
best poets, and are become familiar through their
use of them.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>An examination of Pope’s compounds in the light
of “the received rules of composition,” shows his
examples to be of the usual types. Of noun <i>plus</i>
noun combinations he has such forms as “<i>monarch-savage</i>,”
(“Odyss.” IV), whilst he is credited with
the first use of “the <i>fury-passions</i>” (Epistle III).
More originality and imagination is reflected in his
compound epithets; of those formed from a noun
and a present participle, with the first element usually
in an objective relation to the second, his instances
include “<i>love-darting</i>-eyes” (“Unfortunate Lady”),
as well as others found before his time, like the
Elizabethan “<i>heart-piercing</i> anguish” (<i>ibid.</i>, XII)
and “<i>laughter-loving</i> dame” (<i>ibid.</i>, III). He has
large numbers of compounded nouns and past-participles,
many of which—“<i>moss-grown</i> domes”
(“Eloisa”), “<i>cloud-topped</i> hills” (“Essay on Man,”
I, 100), “<i>Sea-girt</i> isles” (“Iliad,” III)—were common
in the seventeenth century, as well as “borrowed”
examples, such as “<i>home-felt</i> joys” (Epistle II) or
“<i>air-bred</i> people” (“Odyss.,” LX, 330), presumably
from Milton and Drayton respectively. But he has
a few original formations of this type, such as “<i>heaven-directed</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
spire” (Epistle III), “<i>osier-fringed</i> bank,”
(“Odyss.,” XIII), the latter perhaps a reminiscence of
Sabrina’s song in “Comus,” as well as happier combinations,
of which the best examples are “<i>love-born</i>
confidence” (“Odyss.,” X) and “<i>love-dittied</i> airs”
(“Odyss.,” II).</p>

<p>Pope, however, makes his largest use of that type
of compound which can be formed with the greatest
freedom—an adjective, or an adjective used adverbially,
joined to a present or past participle. He
has dozens of examples with the adverbial <i>long</i>,
<i>wide</i>, <i>far</i>, <i>loud</i>, <i>deep</i>, <i>high</i>, etc., as the first element,
most of the examples occurring in the Homer translations,
and being attempts to reproduce the Greek
compounds.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Other instances have a higher æsthetic
value: “<i>fresh-blooming</i> hope” (“Eloisa”), “<i>silver-quivering</i>
rills” (Epistle IV), “<i>soft-trickling</i> waters”
“Iliad,” IX), “sweet airs <i>soft-circling</i>” (<i>ibid.</i>, XVII),
etc. Of the formations beginning with a true adverb,
the most numerous are the quasi-compounds beginning
with “<i>ever</i>”—“<i>ever-during</i> nights,” “<i>ever-fragrant</i>
bowers” (“Odyss.,” XII), etc.; or “<i>well</i>”—“<i>well-sung</i>
woes” (“Eloisa”) or “<i>yet</i>”—“<i>yet-untasted</i>
food” (“Iliad,” XV), etc. These instances do not
reveal any great originality, for the very ease with
which they can be formed naturally discounts largely
their poetic value. Occasionally, however, Pope has
been more successful; perhaps his best examples
of this type are “<i>inly-pining</i> hate” (“Odyss.,” VI—where
the condensation involved in the epithet does
at least convey some impression of power—and “the
<i>softly-stealing</i> space of time,” (“Odyss.,” XV), where
the compound almost produces a happy effect of
personification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Of the irregular type of compound, already mentioned
in connexion with Dryden, Pope has a few
instances—“<i>white-robed</i> innocence” (“Eloisa”), etc.
But perhaps Pope’s happiest effort in this respect is
to be seen in that quatrain from the fourth book of
the “Dunciad,” containing three instances of compound
epithets, which help to remind us that at times
he had at his command a diction of higher suggestive
and evocative power than the plain idiom of his
satiric and didactic verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To isles of fragrance, <i>lily-silver’d</i> vales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffusing languor in the panting gales;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lands of singing or of dancing slaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Love-whisp’ring</i> woods and <i>lute-resounding</i> waves.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of the poets contemporary with Pope only brief
mention need be made from our present point of view.
The poems of Anne, Countess of Winchilsea contain
few instances and those of the ordinary type, a remark
which is equally applicable to the poems of Parnell
and John Phillips. John Gay (1685-1732), however,
though he has many formations found in previous
writers, has also some apparently original compound
epithets which have a certain charm: “<i>health-breathing</i>
breezes” (“A Devonshire Hill,” 10), “<i>dew-besprinkled</i>
lawn” (“Fables,” 50), and “the lark
<i>high-poised</i> in the air” (“Sweet William’s Farewell,”
13). More noteworthy is John Dyer; “Grongar
Hill” has no very striking examples, but his blank
verse poems have one or two not devoid of imaginative
value: “<i>soft-whispering</i> waters” (“Ruins of Rome”)
and “<i>plaintive-echoing</i> ruins” (<i>ibid.</i>); he has been
able to dispense with the “classical” descriptive
terms for hills and mountains (“shaggy,” “horrid,”
“terrible,” etc.), and his new epithets reflect something
at least of that changing attitude towards
natural scenery, of which he was a foremost pioneer:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
“<i>slow-climbing</i> wilds” (“Fleece,” I), “<i>cloud-dividing</i>
hill” (<i>ibid.</i>), and his irregular “<i>snow-nodding</i> crags”
(<i>ibid.</i>, IV).</p>

<p>Neglecting for the moment the more famous of the
blank verse poems, we may notice Robert Blair’s
“Grave” (published 1743), with a few examples,
which mainly allow him to indulge in “classical”
periphrases, such as the “<i>sight-invigorating</i> tube” for
“a telescope.” David Mallet, who imitated his
greater countryman James Thomson, has one or
two noteworthy instances: “pines <i>high-plumed</i>”
(“Amyntor,” II), “<i>sweetly-pensive</i> silence” (“Fragment”),
“spring’s <i>flower-embroidered</i> mantle” (“Excursion,”
I)—suggested, no doubt, by Milton’s “violet-embroidered”—“the
morn <i>sun-tinctured</i>” (<i>ibid.</i>),
compound epithets which betray the influence of the
“Seasons.” Of the other minor blank verse poems
their only aspect noteworthy from our present point
of view is their comparative freedom from compounds
of any description. John Armstrong’s “Art of
Preserving Health” (1744) has only a few commonplace
examples, and the same may be said of the
earlier “The Chase” (1735) by William Somerville,
though he finds a new epithet in his expression “the
strand <i>sea-lav’d</i>” (Bk. III, 431). James Grainger’s
“The Sugar Cane” (1764) shows a similar poverty,
but the “<i>green-stol’d</i> Naiad, of the tinkling rill”
(Canto I), “<i>soft-stealing</i> dews” (Canto III), “<i>wild-careering</i>
clouds” (Canto II), and “<i>cane-crowned</i>
vale” (Canto IV) are not without merit. These
blank verse poems, avowedly modelled on Milton,
might have been expected to attempt the “grandeur”
of their original by high-sounding compounds; but
it was rather by means of latinized words and constructions
that the Miltonic imitators sought to
emulate the grand style; and moreover, as Coleridge
pointed out, Milton’s great epics are almost free from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
compound epithets, it being in the early poems that
“a superfluity” is to be found.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Before turning to the more famous blank verse
poems of the first half of the eighteenth century it
will be convenient at this point to notice one or two
poets whose work represents, on its formal side at
least, a continuation or development of the school
of Pope. The first of these is Richard Savage, whose
only poem of any real merit, “The Wanderer” (apart
perhaps from “The Bastard”), appeared in 1729.
He has only one or two new compounds of noun and
part-participle, such as “the robe <i>snow-wrought</i>”
(“The Wanderer,” I, 55), his favourite combination
being that of an adjective or adverb with a participle,
where, amidst numerous examples of obvious formations,
he occasionally strikes out something new:
“eyes <i>dim-gleaming</i>” (Canto I), “<i>soft-creeping</i>
murmurs” (Canto V), etc. Of his other types the
only other noteworthy compound is the “past-participle”
epithet in his phrase “the <i>amber-hued</i>
cascade” (Canto III), though a refreshing simplicity
of expression is found in such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The bull-finch whistles soft his <i>flute-like</i> note.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poetical work of Dr. Johnson contains scarcely
any instances of compounds, and none either newly
invented or applied. “London” and “The Vanity
of Human Wishes” have each not more than two or
three instances, and even the four poems, in which he
successively treats of the seasons, are almost destitute
of compound epithets, “<i>snow-topped</i> cot” (“Winter”)
being almost the only example.</p>

<p>There are many more instances of compound formations
in the works of Oliver Goldsmith, most of which,
like “<i>nut-brown</i> draughts” (“Deserted Village,” II),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
“<i>sea-borne</i> gales” (“Traveller,” 121), “<i>grass-grown</i>
footway” (“Deserted Village,” 127), had either been
long in the language, or had been used by earlier
eighteenth century poets. There are, however, instances
which testify to a desire to add to the descriptive
power of the vocabulary; in “The Traveller”
we find mention of “the <i>hollow-sounding</i> bittern”
(l. 44), “the <i>rocky-crested</i> summits” (l. 85), “the
<i>yellow-blossomed</i> vale” (l. 293), and the “<i>willow-tufted</i>
bank” (l. 294). For the rest, Goldsmith’s
original compounds are, like so many of this type,
mere efforts at verbal condensation, as “<i>shelter-seeking</i>
peasant” (“Traveller,” 162), “<i>joy-pronouncing</i> eye”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 10), etc.</p>

<p>Of the more famous blank verse poems of the
eighteenth century the first and most important was
“The Seasons” of James Thomson, which appeared
in their original form between 1726 and 1730. The
originality of style, for which Johnson praised him,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
is perhaps to be seen especially in his use of compound
formations; probably no other poet has ever used
them so freely.</p>

<p>As a general rule, Thomson’s compounds fall into
the well-defined groups already mentioned. He has
a number of noun <i>plus</i> noun formations (Type I),
where the first element has usually a purely adjectival
value; “<i>patriot-council</i>” (“Autumn,” 98), “<i>harvest-treasures</i>”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 1217), as well as a few which allow
him to indulge in grandiose periphrasis, as in the
“<i>monarch-swain</i>” (“Summer,” 495) for a shepherd
with his “<i>sceptre-crook</i>” (<i>ibid.</i>, 497). These are all
commonplace formations, but much more originality
is found in his compound epithets. He frequently
uses the noun <i>plus</i> present participle combinations
(Type III), “<i>secret-winding</i>, <i>flower-enwoven</i> bowers”
(“Spring,” 1058) or “<i>forest-rustling</i> mountains”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
(“Winter,” 151), etc. Moreover, the majority of
his compounds are original, though now and then he
has taken a “classical” compound and given it a
somewhat curious application, as in “<i>cloud-compelling</i>
cliffs” (“Autumn,” 801). A few of this class are
difficult to justify logically, striking examples being
“<i>world-rejoicing</i> state” (“Summer,” 116) for “the
state of one in whom the world rejoices,” and “<i>life-sufficing</i>
trees” (<i>ibid.</i>, 836) for “trees that give sustenance.”</p>

<p>Thomson has also numerous instances of the juxtaposition
of nouns and past-participles (Type IV):
“<i>love-enlivened</i> cheeks” (“Spring,” 1080), “<i>leaf-strewn</i>
walks” (“Autumn,” 955), “<i>frost-concocted</i>
glebe” (“Winter,” 706); others of this type
are somewhat obscure in meaning, as “<i>mind-illumined</i>
face” (“Spring,” 1042), and especially
“<i>art imagination-flushed</i>” (“Autumn,” 140), where
economy of expression is perhaps carried to its very
limit.</p>

<p>Thomson’s favourite method of forming compounds
however is that of Type V, each book of “The Seasons”
containing large numbers, the first element (<i>full</i>,
<i>prone</i>, <i>quick</i>, etc.) often repeated with a variant second
element. Sometimes constant repetition in this way
produces the impression of a tiresome mannerism.
Thus “many” joined to present and past-participles
is used irregularly with quasi-adverbial force,
apparently meaning “in many ways,” “many times,”
or even “much,” as “<i>many-twinkling</i> leaves”
(“Spring,” 158), “<i>many-bleating</i> flock” (<i>ibid.</i>, 835),
etc. In the same way the word “mazy” seems to
have had a fascination for Thomson. Thus he has
“the <i>mazy-running</i> soul of melody” (“Spring,” 577),
“the <i>mazy-running</i> brook” (“Summer,” 373), “and
<i>mazy-running</i> clefts” (“Autumn,” 816), etc. Not
all of this type, however, are mere mechanical formations;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
some have real poetic value and bear witness
to Thomson’s undoubted gift for achieving happy
expressive effects. Thus the “<i>close-embowering</i> wood”
(“Autumn,” 208), “the lonesome muse <i>low-whispering</i>”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 955), “the <i>deep-tangled</i> copse” (“Spring,”
594), “the <i>hollow-whispering</i> breeze” (<i>ibid.</i>, 919),
“the <i>grey-grown</i> oaks” (“Summer,” 225), “<i>flowery-tempting</i>
paths” (“Spring,” 1109), “the morn <i>faint-gleaming</i>”
(“Summer,” 48), “<i>dark-embowered</i> firs”
(“Winter,” 813), “the winds <i>hollow-blustering</i>”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 988), “the <i>mossy-tinctured</i> streams” (“Spring,”
380), as well as such passages as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent6">the long-forgotten strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At first <i>faint-warbled</i></div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 946)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thomson’s compound epithets with a true adverb
as the first element (Sixth Type), such as “<i>north-inflated</i>
tempest” (“Autumn,” 892), are not particularly
striking, and some of them are awkward and result
in giving a harsh effect to the verse, as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">goodness and wit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In <i>seldom-meeting</i> harmony combined.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 25-6)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, in “The Seasons” there are to be found
many examples of the type of compound epithet,
already referred to, modelled on the form of a past-participle;
here Thomson has achieved some of his
happiest expressions, charged with real suggestive
power.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Among his instances are such little “word-pictures”
as “<i>rocky-channelled</i> maze” (“Spring,”
401), “the <i>light-footed</i> dews” (“Summer,” 123);<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
“the <i>keen-aired</i> mountain” (“Autumn,” 434) “the
<i>dusky-mantled</i> lawn” (<i>ibid.</i>, 1088), “the <i>dewy-skirted</i>
clouds” (<i>ibid.</i>, 961) Even when he borrows a
felicitous epithet he is able to apply it without loss of
power, as when he gives a new setting to Milton’s
“meek-eyed” applied to “Peace” as an epithet for the
quiet in-coming of the dawn; the “<i>meek-eyed</i> Morn”
(“Summer,” 47).</p>

<p>Thomson makes good and abundant use of compound
epithets, and in this respect, as in others he was
undoubtedly a bold pioneer. His language itself,
from our present point of view, apart from the thought
and outlook on external nature it reflects, entitles
him to that honourable position as a forerunner in
the Romantic reaction with which he is usually
credited. He was not content to accept the stereotyped
diction of his day, and asserted the right of the
poet to make a vocabulary for himself. There is thus
justice in the plea that it is Thomson, rather than
Gray, whom Wordsworth should have marked down
for widening the breach between the language of
poetry and that of prose.</p>

<p>No doubt the prevalence of the compound epithets
in “The Seasons” is due, to some extent at least,
to the requirement of his blank verse line; they helped
him, so to speak, to secure the maximum of effect with
the minimum of word-power; and at times we can
almost see him trying to give to his unrhymed decasyllabics
something of the conciseness and polish to
which Pope’s couplet had accustomed his generation.
But they owe their appearance, of course, to other
causes than the mere mechanism of verse. Thompson’s
fondness for “swelling sound and phrase” has
often been touched upon, and this predilection
finds full scope in the compound epithets; they
play their part in giving colour and atmosphere
to “The Seasons,” and they announce unmistakably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
that the old dead, descriptive diction is
doomed.</p>

<p>Of the blank verse poems of the period only “The
Seasons” has any real claim to be regarded as announcing
the Romantic revolt that was soon to declare
itself unmistakably. But three years after the
appearance of Thomson’s final revision of his poem
the first odes of William Collins were published, at
the same time as those of Joseph Warton, whilst the
work of Thomas Gray had already begun.</p>

<p>There are some two score of compound formations
in the poems of Collins, but many of these—as “<i>love-darting</i>”
(“Poetic Character,” 8), “<i>soul-subduing</i>”
(“Liberty,” 92)—date from the seventeenth century.
One felicitous compound Collins has borrowed from
James Thomson, but in doing so he has invested it
with a new and beautiful suggestiveness. Thomson
had written of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ships <i>dim-discovered</i> dropping from the clouds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 946)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The compound is taken by Collins and given a new
beauty in his description of the landscape as the
evening shadows gently settle upon it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hamlets brown and <i>dim-discovered</i> spires</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Evening,” 37)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where the poetic and pictorial force of the epithet is
perhaps at its maximum.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Collins, however, has not contented himself with
compounds already in the language; he has formed
himself, apparently, almost half of the examples to
be found in his poems. His instances of Types I,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
as of Types V and VI, are commonplace, and he
has but few examples of Type II, the most noteworthy
being “<i>scene-full</i> world” (“Manners,” 78), where the
epithet, irregularly formed, seems to have the meaning
of “abounding in scenery.” Most of his instances of
Type III are either to be found in previous writers,
or are obvious formations like “<i>war-denouncing</i>
trumpets” (“Passions,” 43).</p>

<p>Much more originality is evident in his examples
of Type IV, which is apparently a favourite method
with him. He has “<i>moss-crowned</i> fountain”
(“Oriental Ecl.,” II, 24), “<i>sky-worn</i> robes” (“Pity,”
II), “<i>sedge-crowned</i> sisters” (“Ode on Thomson,”
30), “<i>elf-shot</i> arrows” (“Popular Superstitions,”
27), etc. Some instances here are, strictly speaking,
irregular formations, for the participles, as in “<i>sphere-descended</i>,”
are from intransitive verbs; in other
instances the logical relation must be expressed by a
preposition such, as “<i>with</i>” in “<i>moss-crowned</i>,”
“<i>sedge-crowned</i>”; or “<i>by</i>” in “<i>fancy-blest</i>,” “<i>elf-shot</i>”;
or “<i>in</i>” in “<i>sphere-found</i>,” “<i>sky-worn</i>.”
He has some half-dozen examples of Type VII, three
at least of which—“<i>gay-motleyed</i> pinks” (“Oriental
Eclogues,” III, 17), “<i>chaste-eyed</i> Queen” (“Passions,”
75), and “<i>fiery-tressed</i> Dane” (“Liberty,” 97)—are
apparently his own coinage, whilst others, such as
“<i>rosy-lipp’d</i> health” (“Evening,” 50) and “<i>young-eyed</i>
wit,” have been happily used in the service of
the personifications that play so great a part in his
Odes.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that the use of compounds
by certain writers was already being noticed in the
eighteenth century as something of an innovation
in poetical language. Thus Goldsmith, it would seem,
was under the impression that their increasing employment,
even by Gray, was connected in some way
with the revived study of the older poets, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Spenser.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This supposition is unfounded. Gray, it is
true, uses a large number of compounds, found in
previous writers, but it is chiefly from Milton—e.g.
“<i>solemn-breathing</i> airs” (“Progress of Poesy,” 14;
cp. “Comus,” 555), “rosy-bosomed hours” (“Spring,”
I), or from Pope—e.g. “<i>cloud-topped</i> head” (“Bard,”
34) that he borrows. Moreover, he has many compounds
which presumably he made for himself. Of
Type I he has such instances as “the <i>seraph-wings</i>
of Ecstasy” (“Progress,” 96), “the <i>sapphire-blaze</i>”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 99), etc.; he has one original example of
Type II in his “<i>silver-bright</i> Cynthia” (“Music,” 32),
and two of Type III, when he speaks of the valley of
Thames as a “<i>silver-winding</i> way” (“Eton Ode,”
10), and he finds a new epithet for the dawn in his
beautiful phrase “the <i>incense-breathing</i> Morn” (Elegy
XVII). Of Type IV, he has some half-dozen examples,
only two of which, however, owe their first appearance
to him—the irregularly formed “<i>feather-cinctured</i>
chiefs” (“Progress,” 62) and “the <i>dew-bespangled</i>
wing” (“Vicissitude,” 2). The largest number of
Gray’s compound epithets belong to Type V, where
an adjective is used adverbially with a participle:
“<i>rosy-crowned</i> loves” (“Progress,” 28) and “<i>deep-toned</i>
shell” (“Music,” 23). One of Gray’s examples
of this class of compound, evidently formed on a
model furnished by Thomson, came in for a good deal
of censure. He speaks of “<i>many-twinkling</i> feet”
(“Progress,” 35), and the compound, which indeed is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
somewhat difficult to defend, aroused disapproval in
certain quarters. Lyttleton was one of the first to
object to its use, and he communicated his disapproval
to Walpole, who, however, at once took sides
for the defence. “In answer to your objection,” he
wrote,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> “I will quote authority to which you will
yield. As Greek as the expression is, it struck Mrs.
Garrick; and she says that Mr. Gray is the only poet
who ever understood dancing.” Later, the objection
was revived in a general form by Dr. Johnson. “Gray,”
he says,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> “is too fond of words arbitrarily compounded.
‘Many-twinkling’ was formerly censured as not
analogical: we may say ‘<i>many-spotted</i>’ but scarcely
‘<i>many</i>-spotting.’” The incident is not without its
significance; from the strictly grammatical point of
view the epithet is altogether irregular, unless the first
element is admitted to be an adverb meaning “very
much” or “many times.” But Gray’s fastidiousness
of expression is a commonplace of criticism, and
we may be sure that even when he uses compounds of
this kind he has not forgotten his own clearly expressed
views on the language fit and proper for poetry.</p>

<p>Johnson also objected to another device by which
Gray had sought to enrich the vocabulary of poetry,
as reflected in his use of the “participal” epithet in
-<i>ed</i>.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> If this device for forming new epithets cannot
be grammatically justified, the practice of the best
English poets at least has always been against
Johnson’s dictum, and, as we have seen, it has been
a prolific source of original and valuable compound
epithets. Of this type Gray has some six or seven
examples, the majority of which, however, had long
been in the language, though in the new epithet of
“the <i>ivy-mantled</i> tower” (Elegy IX) we may perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
see an indication of the increasing Romantic sensibility
towards old ruins.</p>

<p>Though not admitted to the same high rank of
poets as Collins and Gray, two of their contemporaries,
the brothers Warton, are at least of as great importance
in the history of the Romantic revival.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> From our
present point of view it is not too fanciful to see a
reflection of this fact in the compound epithets freely
used by both of the Wartons. Thomas Warton is
especially noteworthy; probably no other eighteenth
century poet, with the exception of James Thomson,
has so many instances of new compound formations,
and these are all the more striking in that few of
them are of the mechanical type, readily formed by
means of a commonplace adjective or adverb.
Instances of compound substantives (Type I) are
almost entirely lacking, and the same may be said of
the noun <i>plus</i> adjective epithets (Type II). There
are, however, a few examples of Type III (noun
<i>plus</i> present participle), some of which, as “<i>beauty-blooming</i>
isle” (“Pleasures of Melancholy”), “<i>twilight-loving</i>
bat” (<i>ibid.</i>), and “the woodbines <i>elm-encircling</i>
spray” (“On a New Plantation”), no
doubt owe something to the influence of Thomson.
Instances of Type IV are plentiful, and here again
there is a welcome freshness in Warton’s epithets:
“Fancy’s <i>fairy-circled</i> shrine” (“Monody Written
near Stratford-on-Avon”), “morning’s <i>twilight-tinctured</i>
beam” (“The Hamlet”), “<i>daisy-dappled</i> dale”
(“Sonnet on Bathing”). One instance of this class
of compound epithet, “the <i>furze-clad</i> dale,” is certainly
significant as indicative of the changes that were going
on from the “classical” to the Romantic outlook
towards natural scenery.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Of the other class of compound epithets, Warton
has only a few instances, but his odes gave plenty of
scope for the use of the “participial epithet” (Type
VII), and he has formed them freely: “Pale
Cynthia’s <i>silver-axled</i> car” (“Pleasures of Melancholy”),
“the <i>coral-cinctured</i> stole” (“Complaint of
Cherwell”), “Sport, the <i>yellow-tressed</i> boy” (<i>ibid.</i>).
No doubt many of Thomas Warton’s compound
formations were the result of a conscious effort to find
“high-sounding” terms, and they have sometimes
an air of being merely rhetorical, as in such instances
as “<i>beauty-blooming</i>,” “<i>gladsome-glistering</i> green,”
“<i>azure-arched</i>,” “<i>twilight-tinctured</i>,” “<i>coral-cinctured</i>,”
“<i>cliff-encircled</i>,” “<i>daisy-dappled</i>,” where alliterative
effects have obviously been sought. Yet he deserves
great credit for his attempts to find new words at a
time when the stock epithets and phrases were still
the common treasury of the majority of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>His brother, Joseph Warton, is less of a pioneer,
but there is evident in his work also an effort to
search out new epithets. His compounds include
(Type II) “<i>marble-mimic</i> gods” (“The Enthusiast”);
(Type III) “<i>courage-breathing</i> songs” (“Verses,
1750”), with many instances of Type IV, some
commonplace, as “<i>merchant-crowded</i> towns” (“Ode
to Health”), others more original, as “mirth and
youth nodding <i>lily-crowned</i> heads” (“Ode to Fancy”),
joy, “the <i>rose-crowned, ever-smiling</i> boy” (“Ode
Against Despair”), “the <i>beech-embowered</i> cottage”
(“On The Spring”). Moreover, there are a number in
“The Enthusiast,” which reflect a genuine love of
Nature (“<i>thousand-coloured</i> tulips,” “<i>pine-topp’d</i>
precipice”) and a keen observation of its sights and
sounds.</p>

<p>It is not forcing the evidence of language too much
to say that a similar increasing interest in external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
nature finds expression in some of the compound
epithets to be found in much of the minor poetry of
the period. Thus Moses Mendez (<i>d.</i> 1758)<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> has in
his poem on the various seasons (1751) such conventional
epithets as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On every hill the <i>purple-blushing</i> vine,</div>

<p class="noindent">but others testify to first hand observation as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>pool-sprung</i> gnat on sounding wings doth pass.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Richard Jago (1715-1781)<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, in his “Edgehill” (1767),
has such instances as “the <i>woodland-shade</i>,” “the
<i>wave-worn</i> face,” and “the tillag’d plain <i>wide-waving</i>.”
The Rev. R. Potter,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> who imitated Spenser in his
“Farewell Hymn to the Country” (1749), has happy
examples like “<i>mavis-haunted</i> grove” and “this
<i>flowre-perfumed</i> aire.” In William Whitehead’s
poems<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> there are numerous formations like “<i>cloud-enveloped</i>
towers” (“A Hymn”) and “<i>rock-invested</i>
shades” (“Elegy,” IV). A few new descriptive terms
appear in the work of John Langhorne (1735-1779),<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
“<i>flower-feeding</i> rills” (“Visions of Fancy,” I), “<i>long-winding</i>
vales” (“Genius and Valour”), etc. Michael
Bruce (1746-1767) in his “Lochleven”<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> has, e.g.,
“<i>cowslip-covered</i> banks,” and fresh observation of
bird life is seen in such phrases as “<i>wild-shrieking</i>
gull” and “<i>slow-wing’d</i> crane.” James Graeme
(1749-1772)<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> has at least one new and happy compound
in his line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>blue-gray</i> mist that hovers o’er the hill.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">John Scott (1730-1783)<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> makes more use of compound
formations than most of his minor contemporaries.
He has many instances of Type IV (noun <i>plus</i> participle),
including “<i>rivulet-water’d</i> glade” (Eclogue I),
“<i>corn-clad</i> plain,” “<i>elder-shaded</i> cot” (“Amwell”).
His few instances of Type VI (e.g. “<i>wildly-warbled</i>
strain,” (“Ode” IV)), and of Type VII (e.g. “<i>trefoil-purpled</i>
field” (“Elegy,” III)); “<i>may-flower’d</i>
hedges” (“Elegy,” IV); and “<i>golden-clouded</i> sky,”
(“Ode,” II), are also worthy of notice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another aspect of the rising Romantic
movement was revealing itself in the work of Chatterton.
With the “antiquarianism” of the Rowley poems
we are not here concerned, but the language of both
the “original” work and of the “discovered” poems
contains plenty of material relevant to our special
topic. Chatterton, indeed, seems to have had a
predilection for compound formations, though he has
but few instances of compound substantives (e.g.
“<i>coppice-valley</i>” (“Elegy”), and instances of Type II
(noun <i>plus</i> adjective) are also rare. The other types
of epithets are, however, well represented: “<i>echo-giving</i>
bells” (“To Miss Hoyland”), “<i>rapture-speaking</i>
lyre” (“Song”), etc. (Type III), though
it is perhaps in Type IV that Chatterton’s word-forming
power is best shown: “<i>flower-bespangled</i>
hills” (“Complaint”), “<i>rose-hedged</i> vale” (“Elegy
at Stanton-Drew”), etc., where the first compound
epithet is a new and suggestive descriptive term. His
examples of Type V are also worth noting: “<i>verdant-vested</i>
trees” (“Elegy,” V), “<i>red-blushing</i> blossom”
“Song”), whilst one of the best of them is to be found
in those lines, amongst the most beautiful written by
Chatterton, which reflect something of the new charm
that men were beginning to find in old historic churches
and buildings:</p>

<p class="noindent">The remaining examples of Chatterton’s compound
formations do not call for much attention, though
“<i>gently-plaintive</i> rill” (“Elegy on Phillips”) and
“<i>loudly-dinning</i> stream” (“Ælla,” 84) are new and
fresh. Chatterton has much of the conventional
poetical language and devices of his time throughout
his work, and his compound epithets do not in the mass
vary much from contemporary usage in this respect.
But some of them at least are significant of the position
which he occupies in the history of the Romantic
revival.</p>

<p>The greatest figure in this revival, as it appears to
us now, was William Blake, but from our present
point of view he is almost negligible. It may safely
be said that few poets of such high rank have made
less use of compound formations: in his entire
poetical work scarcely half a dozen instances are to
be found. Yet the majority of these, such as “<i>angel-guarded
bed</i>” (“A Dream,” 2), “<i>mind-forg’d</i>
manacles” (“London,” 8), “Winter’s <i>deep-founded</i>
habitation” (“Winter,” 3), “<i>softly-breathing</i> song”
(“Song,” 2: “Poetical Sketches”) are a sufficiently
striking tribute to his ability to form expressive
compounds had he felt the need. But in the beautiful
purity and simplicity of his diction, for which he has
in our own time at least received adequate praise,
there was no place for long compound formations,
which, moreover, are more valuable and more appropriate
for descriptive poetry, and likely to mar the
pure singing note of the lyric.</p>

<p>It is curious to find a similar paucity of compound
formations in the poems of George Crabbe, the whole
number being well represented by such examples as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
“<i>dew-press’d</i> vale” (“Epistle to a Friend,” 48),
“<i>violet-wing’d</i> Zephyrs” (“The Candidate,” 268),
and “<i>wind-perfuming</i> flowers” (“The Choice”).
No doubt the narrative character of much of Crabbe’s
verse is the explanation of this comparative lack of
compounds, but the descriptions of wild nature that
form the background for many of “The Tales” might
have been expected to result in new descriptive terms.</p>

<p>Two lesser poets of the time are more noteworthy
as regards our especial topic. William Mickle (1735-1788),
in his “Almada Hill” (1781) and his “May
Day,” as well as in his shorter poems, has new epithets
for hills and heights, as in such phrases as “<i>thyme-clad</i>
mountains” and “<i>fir-crown’d</i> hill” (“Sorcerers,”
4). His Spenserian imitation “Syr Martyn,” contains
a few happy epithets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How bright emerging o’er yon <i>broom-clad</i> height</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silver empress of the night appears</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(Canto II, 31)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and “<i>daisie-whitened</i> plain,” “<i>crystal-streamed</i> Esk”
are among his new formations in “Eskdale Braes.”</p>

<p>James Beattie has a large number of compounds
in his poems, and though many of these are mechanical
formations, he has a few new “nature” epithets
which are real additions to the vocabulary of poetical
description, as “<i>sky-mixed</i> mountain” (“Ode to
Peace,” 38), the lake “<i>dim-gleaming</i>” (“Minstrel,”
176), “the <i>wide-weltering</i> waves” (<i>ibid.</i>, 481), the
wave “<i>loose-glimmering</i>” (“Judgment of Paris,”
458). He has also a few instances of Type VII
chiefly utilized, as often with compounds of this type,
as personifying epithets: “the frolic moments <i>purple</i>-pinioned”
(“Judgment of Paris,” 465) and “<i>loose-robed</i>
Quiet” (“Triumph of Melancholy,” 64).</p>

<p>The “Pleasures of Memory” (1792) by Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Rogers has one or two compound formations: “<i>moonlight-chequered</i>
shade” (Part II). Hope’s “<i>summer-visions</i>”
(<i>ibid.</i>) and “the <i>fairy-haunts</i> of long-lost
hours” (<i>ibid.)</i>, have a trace at least of that suggestive
power with which Keats and Shelley were soon to
endow their epithets. Brief reference only need be
made to the works of Erasmus Darwin, which have
already been mentioned as the great example of
eighteenth century stock diction used to the utmost
possible extent. He has plenty of instances of compound
epithets of every type, but his favourite formation
appears to be that of a noun <i>plus</i> part-participle,
as “<i>sun-illumined</i> fane” (“Botanic Garden,” I, 157),
“<i>wave-worn</i> channels” (<i>ibid.</i>, I, 362), and as seen in
such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Her <i>shell-wrack</i> gardens and her <i>sea-fan</i> bowers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Economy of Vegetation,” VI, 82)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many of Darwin’s compounds have a certain charm
of their own; in the mass they contribute towards
that dazzling splendour with which eighteenth century
diction here blazed out before it finally disappeared.</p>

<p>Cowper, like Blake and Crabbe, is not especially
distinguished for his compound epithets. Though
he has a large number of such formations, very few
of them are either new or striking, a remark which
applies equally to his original work and his translations.
Many instances of all the types are to be found in the
“Homer,” but scarcely one that calls for special
mention, though here and there we come across good
epithets well applied: “accents <i>ardour-winged</i>” (IV,
239) or “<i>silver-eddied</i> Peneus” (II, 294).</p>

<p>Before attempting to sum up the use of compound
epithets in eighteenth century poetry, brief reference
may be made to their use in the early work of the two
poets who announced the definite advent of the new
age. Wordsworth in his early poems has many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
instance of compound words, most of which are either
his own formations, or are rare before his time. The
original and final drafts both of the “Evening Walk”
and the “Descriptive Sketches” show some divergence
in this respect, compounds found in the 1793
version being omitted later, whilst on the other new
formations appear in the revised poems. Besides
imitative instances such as “<i>cloud-piercing</i> pine trees”
(D.S., 63), there are more original and beautiful
compounds, such as the “<i>Lip-dewing</i> song and the
<i>ringlet-tossing</i> dance” (<i>ibid.</i>, 132), which does not
appear until the final draft.</p>

<p>Examples of Type IV are “<i>holly-sprinkled</i> steeps”
(E.W., 10), “The sylvan cabin’s <i>lute-enlivened</i> gloom”
(D.S., 134, final); and of Types V and VI, “<i>green-tinged</i>
margin” (D.S., 122), “<i>clear-blue</i> sky” (D.S.,
113), “<i>dim-lit</i> Alps” (D.S., 1793 only, 217), and
“the <i>low-warbled</i> breath of twilight lute” (D.S., 1793,
749). Wordsworth’s early poems, it has been noted,
are almost an epitome of the various eighteenth century
devices for producing what was thought to be a distinctively
poetical style,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> but he soon shakes off this
bondage, and “Guilt and Sorrow,” perhaps the first
poem in which his simplicity and directness of expression
are fully revealed, is practically without instances
of compound epithets.</p>

<p>The critics, it would appear, had already marked
down as a fault a “profusion of new coined double
epithets”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> in a “small volume of juvenile poems”
published by Coleridge in 1794. In replying to, or rather
commenting on, the charge, Coleridge makes an
interesting digression on the use of such formations,
defending them on “the authority of Milton and
Shakespeare,” and suggesting that compound epithets
should only be admitted if they are already “denizens”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of the language, or if the new formation is a genuine
compound, and not merely two words made one by
virtue of the hyphen. “A Language,” he adds, “which
like the English is almost without cases, is indeed in
its very genius unfitted for compounds. If a writer,
every time a compounded word suggests itself to him,
would seek for some other mode of expressing the
same sense, the chances are always greatly in favour
of his finding a better word.” Though there is a
good deal of sound sense in these remarks, we have
only to recall the wealth of beautiful compound
epithets with which Keats, to take only one example,
was soon to enrich the language, to realize that
English poetry would be very much the poorer if the
rule Coleridge lays down had been strictly observed.
It would perhaps be truer to say that the imaginative
quality of the compound epithets coined by a poet
is a good test of his advance in power of expression.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>As regards his own practice, Coleridge goes on to
say<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> that he “pruned the double epithets with no
sparing hand”; but the pruning was not very severe,
judging from a comparison of the two volumes. Yet
these early poems are not without examples of good
compound epithets: “<i>zephyr-haunted</i> brink,” (“Lines
to a Beautiful Spring”), “<i>distant-tinkling</i> stream”
(“Song of the Pixies,” 16), “<i>sunny-tinctured</i> hue”
(<i>ibid.</i>, 43), “<i>passion-warbled</i> strain,” (“To the Rev.
W. J. H.”), etc.</p>

<p>When we review the use of compound epithets in
the poetry of the eighteenth century we are bound to
admit that in this, as in other aspects of the “purely
poetical,” the eighteenth century stands apart from
other periods in our literary history. Most readers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
could probably at will call to their mind half a dozen
compound epithets of Shakespeare and the Elizabethan
period, of Milton, or of more modern writers, such
as Keats, that are, as it were, little poems in themselves,
Shakespeare’s “<i>young-eyed cherubim</i>,” or
Milton’s “<i>grey-hooded even</i>,” or Keats’s “<i>soft-conched
shell</i>.” It is safe to say that few eighteenth century
words or phrases of this nature have captured the
imagination to a similar degree; Collins’s “<i>dim-discovered
spires</i>” is perhaps the only instance that
comes readily to the mind.</p>

<p>There are, of course, as our study has shown, plenty
of instances of good compound epithets, but in the
typical eighteenth century poetry these are rarely
the product of a genuine creative force that endows
the phrase with imaginative life. Even the great
forerunners of the Romantic revolt are not especially
remarkable in this respect; one of the greatest of
them, William Blake, gave scarcely a single new
compound epithet to the language, and whilst this
fact, of course, cannot be brought as a reproach
against him, yet it is, in some respects at least, significant
of the poetical atmosphere into which he was
born. It has often been remarked that when Latin
influence was in the ascendant the formation of new
and striking compound epithets has been very rare in
English poetry, whilst it has been always stimulated,
as we know from the concrete examples of Chapman
and Keats, by the influence of a revived
Hellenism.</p>

<p>Another fact is worthy of attention. Many of the
most beautiful compound epithets in the English
language are nature phrases descriptive of outdoor
sights and sounds. The arrested development, or
the atrophy of the sense of the beauty of the external
world, which is a characteristic of the neo-classical
school, was an unconscious but effective bar to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
formation of new words and phrases descriptive of
outdoor life. The neo-classical poet, with his eye fixed
on the town and on life as lived there, felt no necessity
for adding to the descriptive resources of his vocabulary,
especially when there was to his hand a whole <i>gradus</i>
of accepted and consecrated words and phrases. It
is in the apostles of “the return to Nature” that we
find, however inadequately, to begin with, a new
diction that came into being because these poets had
recovered the use of their eyes and could sense the
beauty of the world around them.</p>

<p>And this fact leads to a further consideration of
the use of compound epithets from the formal viewpoint
of their technical value. It has already been
suggested that their use may not be unconnected with
the mechanism of verse, and the æsthetic poverty of
eighteenth century poetry in this respect may therefore
be not unjustly regarded as an outcome of the two
great prevailing vehicles of expression. In the first
place, there was the heroic couplet as brought to
perfection by Pope. “The uniformity and maximum
swiftness that marked his manipulation of the stopped
couplet was achieved,” says Saintsbury, “not only
by means of a large proportion of monosyllabic final
words, but also by an evident avoidance of long and
heavy vocables in the interior of the lines themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Moreover, perhaps the commonest device to secure
the uniform smoothness of the line was that use of
the “<i>gradus</i> epithet” which has earlier been treated;
these epithets were for the most part stock descriptive
adjectives—<i>verdant</i>, <i>purling</i>, <i>fleecy</i>, <i>painted</i>, and the
like—which were generally regarded by the versifiers
as the only attendant diction of the couplet. If we
compare a typical Pope verse such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let <i>vernal</i> airs through trembling osiers play</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">with the line already quoted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love-whisp’ring woods and lute-resounding waves</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">we may perhaps see that the free use of compound
epithets was not compatible with the mechanism of
the couplet as illustrated in the greater part of Pope’s
practice; they would tend to weaken the balanced
antithesis, and thus spoil the swing of the line.</p>

<p>The most formidable rival of the heroic couplet
in the eighteenth century was blank verse, the
advent of which marked the beginning of the Romantic
reaction in form. Here Thomson may be regarded
as the chief representative, and it is significant that
the large number of compound epithets in his work
are terms of natural description, which, in addition
to their being a reflex of the revived attitude to
natural scenery, were probably more or less consciously
used to compensate readers for the absence of “the
rhyme-stroke and flash” they were accustomed to
look for in the contemporary couplet. “He utilizes
periodically,” to quote Saintsbury again,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> “the
exacter nature-painting, which in general poetic
history is his glory, by putting the distinctive words
for colour and shape in notable places of the verse,
so as to give it character and quality.” These “distinctive
words for colour and shape” were, with
Thomson, for the most part, compound epithets;
almost by the time of “Yardley Oak,” and certainly
by the time of “Tintern Abbey,” blank verse had
been fully restored to its kingdom, and no longer
needed such aid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">PERSONIFICATION AND ABSTRACTION IN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the Preface of 1798, when Wordsworth formulated
his theories with regard to poetical language,
the first “mechanical device of style” against
which he directed his preliminary attack was the use
of “personifications of abstract ideas.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Such personifications,
he urged, do not make any natural or
regular part of “the very language of men,” and as
he wished “to keep the reader in the company of
flesh and blood,” he had endeavoured “utterly to
reject them.” He was ready to admit that they were
occasionally “prompted by passion,” but his predecessors
had come to regard them as a sort of family
language, upon which they had every right to draw.
In short, in Wordsworth’s opinion, abstractions and
personifications had become a conventional method
of ornamenting verse, akin to the “vicious diction,”
from the tyranny of which he wished to emancipate
poetry. The specific point on which he thus challenged
the practice of his predecessors could hardly
be gainsaid, for he had indicted a literary device, or
artifice, which was not only worked to death by the
mere poetasters of the period, but which disfigures
not a little the work of even the great poets of the
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>The literary use of abstraction and personification
was not, it is needless to say, the invention of the
eighteenth century. It is as old as literature itself,
which has always reflected a tendency to interpret or
explain natural phenomena or man’s relations with
the invisible powers that direct or influence human
conduct, by means of allegory, English poetry in the
Middle Ages, especially that of Chaucer, Langland, and
their immediate successors, fitly illustrates the great
world of abstraction which had slowly come into being,
a world peopled by personified states or qualities—the
Seven Deadly Sins, the Virtues, Love, etc.—typifying
or symbolizing the forces which help man, or
beset and ensnare him as he makes his pilgrim’s
progress through this world.</p>

<p>Already the original motive power of allegory was
considerably diminished, even if it had not altogether
disappeared, and, by the time of the “Faerie Queene,”
the literary form which it had moulded for itself had
become merely imitative and conventional, so that
even the music and melody of Spenser’s verse could
not altogether vitalize the shadowy abstractions of his
didactic allegory. With “Paradise Lost” we come to
the last great work in which personified abstractions
reflect to any real extent the original allegorical
motive in which they had their origin. Milton
achieves his supreme effects in personification in that
his figures are merely suggestive, strongly imagined
impressions rather than clean-cut figures. For nothing
can be more dangerous, from the poetic point of
view, than the precise figures which attempt to
depict every possible point of similarity between
the abstract notion and the material representation
imagined.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It is sometimes considered that the mania for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
abstraction was due largely to the influence of the two
poets who are claimed, or regarded, as the founders or
leaders of the new classical school—Dryden and Pope.
As a matter of fact, neither makes any great use of
personification. Dryden has a few abstractions in
his original works, such as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Far from her sight flew Faction, Strife and Pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Envy did but look on</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“First Epistle”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but his examples are mainly to be found in his
modernizations or translations, where of necessity
he takes them from his originals.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Pope makes a greater use of the figure, but even
here there is no excess. There is not a single personification
in the four pastorals of “The Seasons,” a
subject peculiarly adapted to such treatment. In
“Eloisa to Abelard” there are two instances where
some attempt at characterization is made.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> More
instances, though none very striking, are to be found
in “Windsor Forest,” but the poem ends with a massed
group, forming a veritable catalogue of the personified
vices which had done so much service in poetry since
the days of the Seven Deadly Sins.</p>

<p>In other poems Pope uses the device for humorous
or satiric effect, as in the “Pain,” “Megrim,” and
“Ill nature like an ancient maid” (l. 24) of “The Rape
of the Lock;” or the “Science,” “Will,” “Logic,”
etc., of “The Dunciad,” where all are invested with
capital letters, but with little attempt to work up a
definite picture, except, as was perhaps to be expected,
in the case of “Dullness,” which is provided with a
bodyguard (Bk. I, 45-52).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Though, as we have already said, there is no great
use of such figures in the works of Pope, they are
present in such numbers in his satiric and didactic
works as to indicate one great reason for their prevalence
in his contemporaries and successors. After
the Restoration, when English literature entered on a
new era, the changed and changing conditions of
English life and thought soon impressed themselves
on poetry. The keynote to the understanding of
much that is characteristic of this new “classical”
literature has been well summed up in the formula
that “the saving process of human thought was
forced for generations to beggar the sense of beauty.”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
The result was an invasion of poetry by ideas, arguments,
and abstractions which were regarded both as
expressing admirably the new spirit of rationalism, as
well as constituting in themselves dignified subjects
and ornaments of poetry.</p>

<p>This is well illustrated in the case of several of
Pope’s contemporaries. In the works of Thomas
Parnell (1679-1718) abstractions of the conventional
type are plentiful, usually accompanied by a qualifying
epithet: “Fortune fair-array’d” (“An Imitation”),
“Impetuous Discord,” “Blind Mischief,” (“On Queen
Anne’s Peace”), “the soft Pathetic” (“On the
Different Styles of Poetry”). These are only a few
of the examples of the types favoured by Parnell,
where only here and there are human traits added by
means of qualifying epithets or phrases. In one or
two instances, however, there are more detailed
personifications. Thus, in the “Epistle to Dr. Swift,”
which abounds in shadowy abstractions, Eloquence is
fully described for us:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon her cheek sits Beauty ever young</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soul of music warbles on her tongue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, already in Parnell it is evident that
the influence of Milton is responsible for some of
his personifications. In the same poem we get the
invocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come! country Goddess come, nor thou suffice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But bring thy mountain-sister Exercise,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">figures which derive obviously from “L’Allegro.”</p>

<p>In the case of Richard Savage (1696-1743) there is
still greater freedom in the use of personified abstractions,
which, as here the creative instinct is everywhere
subjected to the didactic purpose, become very
wearisome. The “Wanderer” contains long catalogues
of them, in some instances pursued for over
fifty lines.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The device continued to be very popular throughout
the eighteenth century, especially by those who
continue or represent the “Ethical” school of Pope.
First amongst these may be mentioned Edward Young
(1681-1765), whose “Night Thoughts” was first
published between 1742-1744. Young, like his contemporaries,
has recourse to personifications, both for
didactic purposes and apparently to add dignity to
his style. It is probable, too, that in this respect he
owes something to “Paradise Lost”; from Milton no
doubt he borrowed his figure of Death, which, though
poetically not very impressive, seems to have captured
the imagination of Blake and other artists who
have tried to depict it. The figure is at first only
casually referred to in the Fourth Book (l. 96), where
there is a brief and commonplace reference to “Death,
that mighty hunter”; but it is not until the fifth book
that the figure is developed. Yet, though the characterization
is carried to great length, there is no very
striking personification: we are given, instead, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
long-drawn-out series of abstractions, with an attempt
now and then to portray a definite human figure.
Thus</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Like princes unconfessed in foreign courts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who travel under cover, Death assumes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The name and look of life, and dwells among us.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then the poet describes Death as being present
always and everywhere, and especially</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Gaily carousing, to his gay compeers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inly he laughs to see them laugh at him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As absent far.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Young has not, like Milton, been able to conjure
up a definite and convincing vision, and thus he never
achieves anything approaching the overwhelming
effect produced by the phantom of Death in “Paradise
Lost,” called before us in a single verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So spake the grisly Terror.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(P.L., II. 704)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For the rest, Young’s personifications, considering
the nature of his subject, are fewer than might be
expected. Where they occur they often seem to owe
their presence to a desire to vary the monotony of his
moral reflections; as a result we get a number of
abstractions, which may be called personifications
only because they are sometimes accompanied by
human attributes.</p>

<p>Young has also certain other evocations which can
scarcely be called abstractions, but which are really
indistinct, shadowy beings, like the figures of a dream,
as when he describes the phantom of the past:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit walks of every day deceased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(ll. 180-181)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">or the grief of the poet as he ever meets the shades of
joys gone for ever:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">The ghosts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of my departed joys: a numerous train.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here the poet has come near to achieving that effect
which in the hands of the greatest poets justifies the
use of personification as a poetic figure. The more
delicate process just illustrated is distinct both from
the lifeless abstraction and the detailed personification,
for in these cases there is a tinge of personal emotion
which invests these shadowy figures with something
of a true lyrical effect.</p>

<p>The tendency, illustrated in the “Night Thoughts,”
to make a purely didactic use of personification and
abstraction is found to a much greater extent in
Akenside’s “Pleasures of the Imagination,” first
published in 1744, to be considerably enlarged in 1767.
The nature of Akenside’s subject freely admitted of
the use of these devices, and he has not been slow to
avail himself of them.</p>

<p>Large portions of the “Pleasures of the Imagination”
resolve themselves into one long procession of abstract
figures. Very often Akenside contents himself with
the usual type of abstraction, accompanied by a conventional
epithet: “Wisdom’s form celestial” (I, 69),
“sullen Pomp” (III, 216), etc., though sometimes by
means of human attributes or characteristics we are
given partial personifications such as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Power’s purple robes nor Pleasure’s flowery lap.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(l. 216)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And occasionally there are traces of a little more
imagination:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">thy lonely whispering voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O faithful Nature!<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>But on the whole it is clear that with Akenside
abstraction and personification are used simply and
solely for moral and didactic purposes, and not because
of any perception of their potential artistic value.
Incidentally, an interesting side-light on this point is
revealed by one of the changes introduced by the poet
into his revision of his chief work. In the original
edition of 1740 there is an invocation to Harmony
(Bk. I, ll. 20 foll.), with her companion,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Majestic Truth; and where Truth deigns to come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her sister Liberty will not be far.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Before the publication of the revised edition, Akenside,
who at one time had espoused the cause of liberty with
such ardour as to lead to his being suspected of republicanism,
received a Court appointment. In the
revised edition the concluding lines of the invocation
became</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">for with thee comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The guide, the guardian of their majestic rites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wise Order and where Order deigns to come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her sister Liberty will not be far.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(138 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same lavish use of abstractions is seen, not
only in the philosophic poetry proper, but also in
other works, which might perhaps have been expected
to escape the contagion. Charles Churchill (1731-1764),
if we set aside Johnson and Canning, may be
regarded as representing eighteenth century satire in
its decline, after the great figures of Pope and Swift
have disappeared from the scene, and among the
causes which prevent his verse from having but little
of the fiery force and sting of the great masters of
satire is that, instead of the strongly depicted, individual
types of Pope, for example, we are given a heterogeneous
collection of human virtues, vices, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
characteristics, most often in the form of mere abstractions,
sometimes personified into stiff, mechanical
figures.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Only once has Churchill attempted anything
novel in the way of personification, and this in
humorous vein, when he describes the social virtues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With belly round and full fat face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which on the house reflected grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full of good fare and honest glee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The steward Hospitality.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Churchill had no doubt a genuine passion for poetry
and independence, but the <i>saeva indignatio</i> of the
professed censor of public morals and manners cannot
be conveyed to the reader through the medium of
mechanical abstractions which, compared with the
flesh-and-blood creations of Dryden and Pope, show
clearly that for the time being the great line of English
satire has all but come to an end.</p>

<p>Eighteenth century ethical poetry was represented
at this stage by Johnson and Goldsmith, at whose
work it will now be convenient to glance. The
universal truths which Johnson as a stern, unbending
moralist wished to illustrate in “London” (1738)
and “The Vanity of Human Wishes” (1749), might
easily have resulted in a swarm of the abstractions
and personifications fashionable at the time.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> From
this danger Johnson was saved by the depth of feeling
with which he unfolds the individual examples chosen
to enforce his moral lessons. Not that he escapes
entirely; “London” has a few faint abstractions
(“Malice,” “Rapine,” “Oppression”); but though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
occasionally they are accompanied by epithets suggesting
human attributes (“surly Virtue,” “persecuting
Fate,” etc.), as a rule there is no attempt at definite
personification, a remark which also applies to the
“Vanity of Human Wishes.” In his odes to the
different seasons he has not given, however, any
elaborate personifications, but has contented himself
with slight human touches, such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Autumn bends a cloudy brow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of Johnson’s poetical style, regarded from our
present point of view, it may be said to be well
represented in the famous line from “London”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Slow rises Worth by Poverty depressed,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where there is probably no intention or desire to
personify at all, but which is a result of that tendency
towards Latin condensation which the great Doctor
and his contemporaries had introduced into English
prose.</p>

<p>Goldsmith’s poetry has much in common with that
of Johnson, in that both deal to some extent with
what would now be called social problems. But
it is significant of Goldsmith’s historical position
in eighteenth century poetry as representing a sort
of “half-way attitude,” in the matter of poetical
style, between the classical conventional language and
the free and unfettered diction advocated by Wordsworth,
that there are few examples of personified
abstractions in his works, and these confined mainly
to one passage in “The Traveller”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence Ostentation here with tawdry Art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart, etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>At this point it is necessary to hark back for the
purpose of considering other works which had been
appearing alongside of the works just discussed. It
has already been remarked that in this matter of the
use of abstraction and personification the influence
of Milton early asserted itself, and there can be no
doubt that a good deal of it may be traced to the
influence more especially of the early poems. Indeed,
the blank verse poems, which attempted to imitate or
parody the “grand style” of the great epics, furnish
few examples of the personified abstraction. The
first of these, the “Splendid Shilling” and “Cyder”
of John Philips (1705-1706) contains but few instances.
In Somerville’s “Chase” there is occasionally a
commonplace example, such as “brazen-fisted Time,”
though in his ode “To Marlborough” he falls into
the conventional style quickly enough. In the
rest of the blank verse poems Mallet’s “Excursion”
(1738), and his “Amyntor and Theodora” (1744),
comparatively little use is made of the device,
a remark also applicable to Dyer’s “Ruins of
Rome” (1740), and to Grainger’s “Sugar Cane”
(1764).</p>

<p>The fashion for all these blank verse poems had
been started largely by the success of “The Seasons,”
which appeared in its original form from 1726 to 1730,
to undergo more than one revision and augmentation
until the final edition of 1744. Though Thomson’s
work shows very many traces of the influence of
Milton, there is no direct external evidence that his
adoption of blank verse was a result of that influence.
Perhaps, as has been suggested,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> he was weary of
the monotony of the couplet, or at least considered its
correct and polished form incapable of any further
development. At the same time it is clear that having
adopted “rhyme-unfettered verse,” he chose to regard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Milton as a model of diction and style, though he was
by no means a slavish imitator.</p>

<p>With regard to the special problems with which we
are here concerned, it must be noted that when
Thomson was first writing “The Seasons,” the device
of personified abstraction had not become quite so
conventional and forced in its use as at a later date.
Nevertheless examples of the typical abstraction are
not infrequent; thus, in an enumeration of the
passions which, since the end of the “first fresh dawn,”
have invaded the hearts and minds of men, we are
given “Base Envy,” withering at another’s joy;
“Convulsive Anger,” storming at large; and “Desponding
Fear,” full of feeble fancies, etc. (“Spring,”
280-306). Other examples are somewhat redeemed
by the use of a felicitous compound epithet, “Art
imagination-flushed” (“Autumn,” 140), “the lonesome
Muse, low-whispering” (<i>ibid.</i>, 955), etc. In
“Summer” (ll. 1605 foll.) the poet presents one of the
usual lists of abstract qualities (“White Peace,
Social Love,” etc.), but there are imaginative touches
present that help to vitalize some at least of the
company into living beings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The tender-looking Charity intent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On gentle deeds, and shedding tears through smiles—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the passage is thus a curious mixture of mechanical
abstractions with more vivid and inspired conceptions.</p>

<p>Occasionally Thomson employs the figure with
ironical or humorous intention, and sometimes not
ineffectively, as in the couplet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then sated Hunger bids his brother Thirst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Produce the mighty bowl.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Autumn,” 512)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He is also fond of the apostrophic personification,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
often feebly, as when, acting upon a suggestion from
Mallet,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes, Inspiration, from thy hermit seat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By mortal seldom found, etc.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” l. 15)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for the seasons themselves, we do not find any
very successful attempts at personification. Thomson
gives descriptive impressions rather than abstractions:
“gentle Spring, ethereal mildness” (“Spring,” 1),
“various-blossomed Spring” (“Autumn,” 5); or
borrowing, as often, an epithet from Milton, “refulgent
Summer” (“Summer,” 2); or “surly Winter”
(“Spring,” 11).</p>

<p>But in these, and similar passages, the seasons can
hardly be said to be distinctly pictured or personified.
In “Winter,” however, there is perhaps a more
successful attempt at vague but suggestive personification:<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See Winter comes, to rule the varied year,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sullen and sad, with all his rising train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vapours, and clouds and storms.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But on the whole Thomson’s personifications of the
seasons are not, poetically, very impressive. There
is little or no approach to the triumphant evocation
with which Keats conjures up Autumn for us, with all
its varied sights and sounds, and its human activities
vividly personified in the gleaner and the winnower</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">sitting careless on a granary floor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the couplet in which Coleridge brings before us a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
subtle suggestion of the spring beauty, to which the
storms and snows are but a prelude:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And winter, slumbering in the open air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Work without Hope”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet Thomson, as might be expected in a forerunner of
the Romantic school, is not altogether without a gift
for these embryonic personifications, as they have
been called, when by means of a felicitous term or
epithet the whole conception which the poet has in
mind is suddenly galvanized into life and endowed
with human feelings and emotions. Such evocations
are of the very stuff of which poetry is made, and at
their highest they possess the supreme power of
stirring or awakening in the mind of the reader other
pictures or visions than those suggested by the mere
personification.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>Though some of Thomson’s instances are conventional
or commonplace, as in the description of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">the grey grown oaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the calm village in their verdant arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sheltering, embrace,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 225-227)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and others merely imitative, as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">the rosy-footed May</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steals blushing on,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Spring,” 489-490)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet there are many which call up by a single word a
vivid and picturesque expression, such as the “hollow-whispering
breeze” (“Summer,” 919) or the poet’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
description of the dismal solitude of a winter landscape</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">It freezes on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till Morn, late rising o’er the drooping world</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Winter,” 744)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the beautiful description of a spring dawn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The meek-eyed Morn appears, mother of dews</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At first faint-gleaming in the dappled east.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Summer,” 48-49)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Adverting to the question of Milton’s influence
on the prevalent mania for personification, it is undoubted
that the early poems may be held largely
responsible. Their influence first began noticeably
to make itself felt in the fifth decade of the century,
when their inspiration is to be traced in a great
deal of the poetic output of the period, including
that of Joseph and Thomas Warton, as well as
of Collins and Gray. Neglecting for the moment
the greater poets who drew inspiration from this
source, it will be as well briefly to consider first
the influence of Milton’s minor poems on the obscure
versifiers, for it is very often the case that the minor
poetry of an age reflects most distinctly the peculiarities
of a passing literary fashion. As early as 1739
William Hamilton of Bangour<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> imitated Milton in his
octosyllabic poem “Contemplation,” and by his
predilection for abstraction foreshadowed one of the
main characteristics of the Miltonic revival among
the lesser lights. A single passage shows this clearly
enough:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Anger with wild disordered pace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And malice pale of famish’d face:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud-tongued Clamour get thee far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence, to wrangle at the bar:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Five or six years later Mason’s Miltonic imitations
appeared—“Il Bellicoso” and “Il Pacifico”—which
follow even more slavishly the style of “L’Allegro”
and “Il Penseroso,” so that there is no need for
Mason’s footnote to “Il Bellicoso” describing the
poem with its companion piece as this “very, very
juvenile imitation.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> “Il Bellicoso” begins with the
usual dismissal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence, dull lethargic Peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Born in some hoary beadsman’s cell obscure,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and subsequently we are introduced to Pleasure,
Courage, Victory, Fancy, etc. There is a similar
exorcism in “Il Pacifico,” followed by a faint personification
of the subject of the ode, attended by a
“social smiling train” of lifeless abstractions.</p>

<p>The pages of Dodsley<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> furnish abundant testimony
to the prevalence of this kind of thing. Thus “Penshurst”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
by F. Coventry is another close imitation of
Milton’s companion poems, with the usual crowd of
abstractions. The same thing is met with in the
anonymous “Vacation,”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and in the “Valetudinarian,”
said to be written by Dr. Marriott.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to illustrate further the Milton
vogue, which thus produced so large a crop of imitations,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
except to say that there is significant testimony
to the widespread prevalence of the fashion in the fact
that a parody written “in the Allegoric, Descriptive,
Alliterative, Epithetical, Fantastic, Hyperbolical, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Diabolical Style of our modern Ode writers and
monody-mongers”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> soon appeared. This was the
anonymous “Ode to Horror,” a humorous burlesque,
especially of the “Pleasures of Melancholy.” The
Wartons stand high above the versifiers at whose
productions we have just looked, but nevertheless
there was some justification for the good-humoured
parody called forth by their works.</p>

<p>In 1746 there appeared a small volume entitled
“Odes on Various Subjects,” a collection of fourteen
odes by Joseph Warton.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The influence of Milton is
especially seen in the odes “To Fancy,” “To Health,”
and to “The Nightingale,” but all betray definitely
the source of their inspiration. Thus in the first
named:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Me, Goddess, by the right hand lead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sometimes thro’ the yellow mead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Joy and White-robed Peace resort</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Venus keeps her festive court.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All the odes of Warton betray an abundant use of
abstractions, in the midst of which he rarely displays
anything suggestive of spontaneous inspiration. His
few personifications of natural powers are clearly
imitative. “Evening” is “the meek-eyed Maiden
clad in sober gray” and Spring comes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">array’d in primrose colour’d robe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We feel all the time that the poet drags in his stock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
of personified abstractions only because he is writing
odes, and considers that such devices add dignity to
his subject.</p>

<p>At the same time it is worth noting that almost
the same lavish use of these lay figures occurs in his
blank verse poem, “The Enthusiast,” or “The Lover
of Nature” (1740), likewise written in imitation of
Milton, and yet in its prophetic insight so important
a poem in the history of the Romantic revival.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
Lines such as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Famine, Want and Pain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sunk to their graves their fainting limbs</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are frequent, while there is a regular procession of
qualities, more or less sharply defined, but not
poetically suggestive enough to be effective.</p>

<p>The younger of the two brothers, Thomas Warton,
who by his critical appreciation of Spenser did much
in that manner to help forward the Romantic movement,
was perhaps still more influenced by Milton.
His ode on “The Approach of Summer” shows to
what extent he had taken possession of the verse,
language, and imagery of Milton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Haste thee, nymph, and hand in hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With thee lead a buxom band</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bring fantastic-footed Joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With Sport, that yellow-tressed boy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leisure, that through the balmy sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chases a crimson butterfly.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But nearly all his poems provide numerous instances
of personified abstraction, especially the lines “Written
at Vale Abbey,” which seems to exhaust, and present
as thin abstractions, the whole gamut of human
virtues and vices, emotions and desires.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>There is a certain irony in the fact that the two men
who, crudely, perhaps, but nevertheless unmistakably,
adumbrated the Romantic doctrine, should have been
among the foremost to indulge in an excess against
which later the avowed champion of Romanticism
was to inveigh with all his power. This defect was
perhaps the inevitable result of the fact that the
Wartons had apparently been content in this respect
to follow a contemporary fashion as revealed in
the swarm of merely mechanical imitations of
Milton’s early poems. But their subjects were on
the whole distinctly romantic, and this fact, added
to their critical utterances, gives them real historical
importance. Above all, it is to be remembered that
they have for contemporaries the two great poets
in whom the Romantic movement was for the first
time adequately exemplified—William Collins and
Thomas Gray.</p>

<p>The first published collection of Collins’s work,
“Odes on Several Descriptive and Allegorical Subjects”
(1746), was, as we have seen, if not neglected or
ignored by the public, at least received with marked
indifference, owing largely no doubt to the abstract
nature of his subjects, and the chiselled severity of his
treatment.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> In other words, Collins was pure classical
and not neo-classical; he had gone direct back to the
“gods of Hellas” for his inspiration, and his verse
had a Hellenic austerity and beauty which could make
little or no appeal to his own age. At the same time
it was permeated through and through with new and
striking qualities of feeling and emotion that at once
aroused the suspicions of the neo-classicists, with
Johnson as their mentor and spokesman. The “Odes”
were then, we may say, classical in form and romantic
in essence, and it is scarcely a matter for surprise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
that a lukewarm reception should have been their
lot.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Collins has received merited praise for the charm
and precision of his diction generally, and the fondness
for inverting the common order of his words—Johnson’s
chief criticism of his poetical style<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>—is to the modern
mind a venial offence compared with his use of personified
abstractions. On this point Johnson has
nothing to say, an omission which may be regarded
as significant of the extent to which personification
had invaded poetry, for the critic, if we may
judge from his silence, seems to have considered
it natural and legitimate for Collins also to have
made abundant use of this stock and conventional
device.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, that the extensive use
which Collins makes of the figure is the result in a
large measure of his predilection for the ode—a form
of verse very fashionable towards the middle of the
century. As has already been noted, odes were being
turned out in large numbers by the poetasters of the
time, in which virtues and vices, emotions and passions
were invoked, apostrophized, and dismissed with
appropriate gestures, and it is probable that the
majority of these turgid and ineffective compositions
owed their appearance to the prevalent mania for
personification. Young remarked with truth<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> that
an ode is, or ought to be, “more spontaneous and more
remote from prose” than any other kind of poetry;
and doubtless it was some vague recognition of this
fact, and in the hope of “elevating” their style, that
led the mere versifiers to adopt the trick. But as they
worked the mechanical personification to death, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
quickly robbed it of any impressiveness it may ever
have had.</p>

<p>This might quite fairly be described as the state of
affairs with regard to the use of personified abstraction
when Collins was writing his “odes,” but while it is
true that he indulges freely in personification, it is
scarcely necessary to add that he does so with a
difference; his Hellenic training and temperament
naturally saved him from the inanities and otiosities
of so much contemporary verse. To begin with,
there are but few examples of the lifeless abstraction,
and even in such cases there is usually present a happy
epithet, or brief description that sets them on a higher
level than those that swarm even in the odes of the
Wartons. Thus in the “Ode on the Poetical
Character,” “the shadowy tribes of mind,” which
had been sadly overworked by Collins’s predecessors
and contemporaries, are brought before us with a new
and fresh beauty that wins instant acceptance for
them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But near it sat ecstatic Wonder</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listening the deep applauding thunder</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And truth in sunny vest arrayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By whom the tassel’s eyes were made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the shadowy tribes of mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In braided dance their murmurs joined.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Instances of the mechanical type so much in favour
are, however, not lacking, as in this stanza from the
“Verses” written about bride-cake:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ambiguous looks that scorn and yet relent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Denial mild and firm unaltered truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reluctant pride and amorous faint consent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And melting ardours and exulting youth.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The majority of Collins’s personified abstractions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
are, however, vague in outline, that is to say, they
suggest, but do not define, and are therefore the more
effective in that the resulting images are almost
evanescent in their delicacy. Thus in the “Ode to
Pity” the subject is presented to us in magic words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Long pity, let the nations view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy sky-worn robes of tender blue</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And eyes of dewy light,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst still another imaginative conception is that of
“Mercy”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">who sitt’st a smiling bride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Valour’s armed and awful side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gentlest of sky-born forms and best adorned.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The “Ode to the Passions” is in itself almost an
epitome of the various ways in which Collins makes
use of personification. It is first to be noted that he
rarely attempts to clothe his personifications in long
and elaborate descriptions; most often they are given
life and reality by being depicted, so to speak, moving
and acting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Revenge impatient rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with a withering look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The war-denouncing trumpet took;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whilst his strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even the figures, seen as it were but for a moment,
are flashed before us in this manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">With woful measures wan Despair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low sullen sounds his grief beguiled</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dejected Pity at his side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her soul-subduing voice applied</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and the vision of hope with “eyes so fair” who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">smiled and waved her golden hair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In this ode Collins gives us also imaginative cameos,
we might call them, vividly delineated and presented
like the figures on the Grecian urn that inspired
Keats. Thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While as his flying fingers kissed the strings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Love framed with mirth a gay fantastic round.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and, with its tinge of probably unconscious humour—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Brown exercise rejoiced to hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Sport leapt up and seized his beechen spear.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From these and similar instances, we receive a
definite impression of that motion, which is at the
same time repose, so characteristic of classical
sculptuary.</p>

<p>Most of the odes considered above are addressed to
abstractions. In the few instances where Collins
invokes the orders or powers of nature even greater
felicity is shown in the art with which he calls up and
clothes in perfect expression his abstract images. The
first of the seasons is vaguely but subtly suggested to
us in the beautiful ode beginning “How sleep the
brave”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">When Spring with dewy fingers cold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Returns to deck their hallowed mould,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">She there shall dress a sweeter sod</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than fancy’s feet have ever trod.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is rather a simile than a personification, but yet
there is conveyed to us a definite impression of a
shadowy figure that comes to deck the earth with
beauty, like a young girl scattering flowers as she walks
along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>But the workmanship of Collins in this respect is
seen in its perfection in the “Ode to Evening.” There
is no attempt to draw a portrait or chisel a statue; the
calm, restful influence of evening, its sights and sounds
that radiate peace and contentment, even the very
soul of the landscape as the shades of night gather
around, are suggested by master touches, whilst the
slow infiltration of the twilight is beautifully suggested:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy dewy fingers draw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gradual dusky veil.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The central figure is still the same evanescent being,
the vision of a maiden, endowed with all the grace of
beauty and dignity, into whose lap “sallow Autumn”
is pouring his falling leaves, or who now goes her way
slowly through the tempest, while</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Winter, yelling through the troublous air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Affrights thy shrinking train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rudely rends thy robe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If we had no other evidence before us, Collins’s use
of personified abstraction would be sufficient in itself
to announce that the new poetry had begun. He
makes use of the device as freely, and even now and
then as mechanically, as the inferior versifiers of his
period, but instead of the bloodless abstractions,
his genius enabled him to present human qualities
and states in almost ethereal form. Into them he has
breathed such poetic life and inspiration that in their
suggestive beauty and felicity of expression they stand
as supreme examples of personification used as a
legitimate poetical device, as distinct from a mere
rhetorical figure or embellishment.</p>

<p>This cannot be said of Gray, in whose verse mechanical
personifications crowd so thickly that, as Coleridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
observed in his remarks on the lines from “The
Bard,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Youth at the prow and Pleasure at the helm</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">it depends “wholly on the compositors putting or not
putting a small Capital, both in this and in many
other passages of the same poet, whether the words
should be personifications or mere abstractions.”<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to account for this devotion of Gray to
the “new Olympus,” thickly crowded with “moral
deities” that his age had brought into being, except
on the assumption that contemporary usage in this
respect was too strong for him to resist. For it cannot
be denied that very many of the beings that swarm in
his odes do not differ in their essential character from
the mechanical figures worked to death by the ode-makers
of his days; even his genius was not able to
clothe them all in flesh and blood. In the “Eton
College” ode there is a whole stanza given over to a
conventional catalogue of the “fury passions,” the
“vultures of the mind”; and similar thin abstractions
people all the other odes. Nothing is visualized: we
see no real image before us.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Even the famous
“Elegy” is not without its examples of stiff personification,
though they are not present in anything
like the excess found elsewhere. The best that can
be said for abstractions of this kind is that in their
condensation they represent an economy of expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
that is not without dignity and effectiveness, and
they thus sometimes give an added emphasis to the
sentiment, as in the oft-quoted</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their homely joys and destiny secure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The short and simple annals of the poor.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gray rarely attempts to characterize his figures
other than by the occasional use of a conventional
epithet, and only here and there has the personification
been to any extent filled in so as to form at least
an outline picture. In the “Hymn to Adversity,”
Wisdom is depicted</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">in sable garb arrayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Immersed in rapturous thought profound,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst other slight human touches are to be found here
and there: as in “Moody Madness, laughing wild”
(“Ode on a Distant Prospect”). His personifications,
however, have seldom the clear-cut outlines we find
in Collins, nor do they possess more than a tinge of the
vividness and vitality the latter could breathe into
his abstractions. Yet now and then we come across
instances of the friezes in which Collins excels, moving
figures depicted as in Greek plastic art</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">Antic sports and blue-eyed Pleasures,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Frisking light in frolic measures</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Progress of Poesy”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the beautiful vision in the “Bard,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Bright Rapture calls and soaring as she sings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waves in the eyes of heaven her many-coloured wings.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And in the “Ode on Vicissitude” Gray has one
supreme example of the embryonic personification,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
when the powers or orders of nature are invested with
human attributes, and thus brought before us as living
beings, in the form of vague but suggestive impressions
that leave to the imagination the task of filling in the
details:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Now the golden Morn aloft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Waves her dew-bespangled wing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With vernal cheek and whisper soft</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">She woos the tardy spring.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in the main, and much more than the poet
with whom his name is generally coupled, it is perhaps
not too much to say that Gray was content to handle
the device in the same manner as the uninspired
imitators of the “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso.”
Not that he was unaware of the danger of such a tendency
in himself and others. “I had rather,” he
wrote to Mason<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> when criticizing the latter’s “Caractacus,”
“some of the personages—‘Resignation,’
‘Peace,’ ‘Revenge,’ ‘Slaughter,’ ‘Ambition’—were
stripped of their allegorical garb. A little simplicity
here and there in the expression would better
prepare the high and fantastic harpings that follow.”
In the light of this most salutary remark, Gray’s own
procedure is only the more astonishing. His innumerable
personifications may not have been regarded by
Johnson as contributory to “the kind of cumbrous
splendour” he wished away from the odes, but the
fact that they are scarce in the “Elegy” is not without
significance. The romantic feeling which asserts
itself clearly in the odes, the new imaginative conceptions
which these stock figures were called upon to
convey, the perfection of the workmanship—these
qualities were more than sufficient to counterweigh
Gray’s licence of indulgence in a mere rhetorical
device. Yet Coleridge was right in calling attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
to this defect of Gray’s style, especially as his censure
is no mere diatribe against the use of personified
abstraction: it is firmly and justly based on the
undeniable fact that Gray’s personifications are for
the most part cold and lifeless, that they are mere
verbal abstractions, utterly devoid of the redeeming
vitality, which Collins gives to his figures.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> It is for
this reason perhaps that his poetry in the mass has
never been really popular, and that the average
reader, with his impatience of abstractions, has
been content, with Dr. Johnson, to pronounce boldly
for “The Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.”</p>

<p>Before proceeding to examine the works of the
other great poets who announce or exemplify the
Romantic revival, it will be convenient at this point
to look at some of the Spenserian imitations, which
helped to inspire and vitalize the revival.</p>

<p>Spenser was the poet of mediaeval allegory. In
the “Faerie Queene,” for the first time a real poet,
endowed with the highest powers of imagination and
expression, was able to present the old traditional
abstractions wonderfully decked up in a new and
captivating guise. The personages that move like
dream figures through the cantos of the poem are
thus no mere personified abstractions: they are
rather pictorial emblems, many of which are limned
for us with such grandeur of conception and beauty
of execution as to secure for the allegorical picture a
“willing suspension of disbelief,” whilst the essentially
romantic atmosphere more than atones for the
cumbrous and obsolete machinery adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Spenser to inculcate the lessons of “virtuous and
gentle discipline.”</p>

<p>Though the eighteenth century Spenserians make a
plentiful use of personified abstraction, on the whole
their employment of this device differs widely from its
mechanical use by most of their contemporaries: in
the best of the imitations there are few examples of
the lifeless abstraction. Faint traces at least of the
music and melody of the “Faerie Queene” have been
caught and utilized to give a poetic charm even to
the personified virtues and vices that naturally appear
in the work of Spenser’s imitators. Thus in William
Thompson’s “Epithalamium” (1736), while many
of the old figures appear before us, they have something
of the new charm with which Collins was soon to
invest them. Thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Liberty, the fairest nymph on ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The flowing plenty of her growing hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diffusing lavishly ambrosia round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth smil’d, and Gladness danc’d along the sky.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The epithets which accompany the abstractions are
no longer conventional (“Chastity meek-ey’d,”
“Modesty sweet-blushing”) and help to give touches
of animation to otherwise inanimate figures. In the
“Nativity” (1757) there is a freer use of the mere
abstraction that calls up no distinct picture, but even
here there are happy touches that give relief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Faith led the van, her mantle dipt in blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steady her ken, and gaining on the skies.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the “Hymn to May” (1787) Thompson personified
the month whose charms he is singing, the result being
a radiant figure, having much in common with the
classical personifications of the orders or powers of
nature:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A silken camus, em’rald green</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gracefully loose, adown her shoulder flow.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>In Shenstone’s “Schoolmistress” (1737-1742)
instances of personification are rare, and, where they
do occur, are merely faint abstractions like “Learning
near her little dome.” It is noteworthy that one of
the most successful of the Spenserian imitations should
have dispensed with the cumbrous machinery of
abstract beings that, on the model of the “Faerie
Queene,” might naturally have been drawn upon.
The homely atmosphere of the “Schoolmistress,”
with its idyllic pictures and its gentle pathos, would,
indeed, have been fatally marred by their introduction.</p>

<p>The same sparing use of personification is evident
in the greatest of the imitations, James Thomson’s
“Castle of Indolence” (1748). A theme of this
nature afforded plenty of opportunity to indulge in
the device, and Thomson, judging from its use of the
figure in some of his blank verse poems, might have
been expected to take full advantage. But there are
less than a score of examples in the whole of the poem.
Only vague references are made to the eponymous
hero: he is simply “Indolence” or “tender
Indolence” or “the demon Indolence.” For the
rest Thomson’s few abstractions are of the stock
type, though occasionally more realistic touches
result, we may suppose, from the poet’s sense of
humour as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sleepless Gout here counts the crowing cock.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Only here and there has Thomson attempted full-length
portraits in the Spenserian manner, as when
Lethargy, Hydropsy, and Hypochondria are described
with drastic realism.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The works of the minor Spenserians show a greater
use of personified abstraction, but even with them there
is no great excess. Moreover, where instances do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
occur, they show imaginative touches foreign to the
prevalent types. Thus in the “Vision of Patience”
by Samuel Boyce (d. 1778),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Silence sits on her untroubled throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if she left the world to live and reign alone,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while Patience stands</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In robes of morning grey.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Occasionally the personified abstractions, though
occurring in avowedly Spenserian imitations, obviously
owe more to the influence of “L’Allegro”; as in
William Whitehead’s “Vision of Solomon” (1730),
where the embroidered personifications are much
more frequent than the detailed images given by
Spenser.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>The work of Chatterton represents another aspect
of this revival of the past, but it is curious to find
that, in his acknowledged “original” verse there are
not many instances of the personified abstraction,
whilst they are freely used in the Rowley poems.
Where they do occur in his avowedly original work
they are of the usual type, though more imaginative
power is revealed in his personification of Winter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Pale rugged Winter bending o’er his tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His grizzled hair bedropt with icy dew:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His eyes a dusky light congealed and dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His robe a tinge of bright ethereal blue.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From our special point of view the “antiquarianism”
of the Rowley poems might almost be disproved by
the prevalence of abstractions and personifications,
which in most instances are either unmistakably
of the eighteenth century or which testify to the new
Romantic atmosphere now manifesting itself. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
stock types of frigid abstraction are all brought on
the stage in the manner of the old Moralities, and each
is given an ample speaking part in order to describe
his own characteristics.</p>

<p>But in addition to these lifeless abstractions, there
are to be found in the Rowley poems a large number
of detailed and elaborate personifications. Some of
these are full length portraits in the Spenserian
manner, and now and then the resulting personification
is striking and beautiful, as when, in “Ælla”
(59), Celmond apostrophizes Hope, or the evocation
of Truth in “The Storie of William Canynge.”</p>

<p>Chatterton has also in these poems a few personifications
of natural powers, but these are mainly
imitative as in the lines (“Ælla,” 94) reminiscent of
Milton and Pope<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright sun had in his ruddy robes been dight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the red east he flitted with his train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hours drew away the robe of night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her subtle tapestry was rent in twain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the evocation of the seasons themselves, as in
“Ælla” (32),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Autumn sere and sunburnt doth appear</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With his gold hand gilding the falling leaf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bringing up Winter to fulfil the year</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bearing upon his back the ripened sheaf,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">conveys a fresh and distinct picture that belongs to
the new poetry, and has in it a faint forecast of Keats.</p>

<p>It remains to look at the work of the later eighteenth
century poets, who announce that if the Romantic
outburst is not yet, it is close at hand. The first and
greatest of these is William Blake. His use of personification
in the narrower sense which is our topic, is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of course, formally connected with the large and
vital question of his symbolism, to treat of which here
in any detail is not part of our scheme.</p>

<p>In its widest sense, however, Blake’s mysticism
may be connected with the great mediaeval world of
allegory: it is “an eddy of that flood-tide of symbolism
which attained its tide-mark in the magic of the
Middle Ages.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But the poet himself unconsciously
indicates the vital distinction between the new
symbolism, which he inaugurates, and the old, of
which the personified abstractions of his eighteenth
century predecessors may be regarded as faint and
faded relics. “Allegory addressed to the intellectual
powers,” he wrote to Thomas Butts,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> “while it is
altogether hidden from the corporeal understanding,
is my definition of the most surprising poetry.”</p>

<p>On its formal side, and reduced to its simplest
expression, we may narrow down for our present
purpose the whole system to the further distinction
drawn by Blake between Allegory and Vision.
Allegory is “formed by the daughters of Memory”
or the deliberate reason; Vision “is surrounded by
the daughters of Inspiration.” Here we have a key
to the classification of personified abstractions in the
eighteenth century, and, for that matter, at any and
every period. Abstractions formed by the deliberate
reason are usually more or less rhetorical embellishments
of poetry, and to this category belong the great
majority of the personifications of eighteenth century
verse. They are “things that relate to moral virtues”
or vices, but they cannot truly be called allegorical,
for allegory is a living thing only so long as the ideas
it embodies are real forces that control our conduct.
The inspired personification, which embodies or brings
with it a real vision, is the truly poetical figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>In Blake’s own practice we find only a few instances
of the typical eighteenth century abstraction. In the
early “Imitation of Spenser” there are one or two
examples:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Such is sweet Eloquence that does dispel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Envy and Hate that thirst for human gore,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst others are clearly Elizabethan reminiscences,
like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mournful lean Despair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brings me yew to deck my grave,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Memory, hither come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tune your merry notes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“The Island in the Moon” furnishes grotesque
instances, such as that of old Corruption dressed in
yellow vest. In “The Divine Image,” from the
“Songs of Innocence,” while commonplace virtues
are personified, the simple direct manner of the
process distinguishes them from their prototypes
in the earlier moral and didactic poetry of the century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For Mercy has a human heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pity a human face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Love, the human form divine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Peace the human dress.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An instance of personification raised to a higher power
is found in Blake’s letter to Butts<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With Happiness stretch’d across the hills,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a cloud that dewy sweetness distils,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whilst elsewhere personified abstractions appear with
new epithets, the most striking example being in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
“Earth’s Answer,” from the “Songs of Experience”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Prison’d on watry shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Starry</i> Jealousy does keep my den.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Moreover, Blake’s figures are often presented in an
imaginative guise that helps to emphasize the gulf
fixed between him and the majority of his contemporaries
and predecessors. Thus “Joy” is twice
depicted as a bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Joys upon our branches sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chirping loud and singing sweet</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Song”—“Poetical Sketches”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcome, stranger, to this place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Joy doth sit on every bough.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Song by a Shepherd”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Blake’s youthful work the personifications of
natural powers, though in most cases clearly imitative
are yet striking in their beauty and power of suggestion.
The influence of “Ossian” is seen in such “prose”
personifications as “The Veiled Evening walked
solitary down the Western hills and Silence reposed
in the valley” (“The Couch of Death”), and “Who
is this that with unerring step dares to tempt the wild
where only Nature’s foot has trod, ’Tis Contemplation,
daughter of the Grey Morning” (“Contemplation”).
Here also are evocations of the seasons which, whatever
they may owe to Thomson or Collins, are new in that
we actually get a picture of Spring with “dewy locks”
as she looks down</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thro’ the clear windows of the morning</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of summer with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ruddy limbs and flourishing hair,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">of the “jolly autumn,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">laden with fruits and stained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the blood of the grape;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and of winter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">a dreadful monster whose skin clings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To her strong bones.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thomson, we have seen, had not been altogether
successful in his personification of the seasons: here
they are brought vividly and fittingly before us.
When we think of the hosts of puppets that in the
guise of personified abstractions move mechanically
through so much of eighteenth century verse, and
compare them with the beautiful visions evoked by
Blake, we know from this evidence alone that the
reign of one of the chief excesses of the poetical
language of the time is near its end. It is not that
Blake’s conceptions are all flesh and blood creations:
often they are rather ethereal beings, having something
in common with the evanescent images of
Collins. But the rich and lofty imagination that has
given them birth is more than sufficient to secure their
acceptance as realities capable of living and moving
before us; the classical abstraction, cold and lifeless,
has now become the Romantic personification clothed
in beauty and animated with life and inner meaning.</p>

<p>In the year of the “Poetical Sketches” (1783)
George Crabbe published “The Village,” his first
work to meet with any success. But whilst Blake
gloriously announces the emancipation of English
poetry, Crabbe for the most part is still writing on in
the old dead style. The heroic couplets of his earliest
works have all the rhetorical devices of his predecessors
in that measure, and amongst these the prevalence of
personified abstractions is not the least noteworthy.
The subject of his first poem of any length, “Inebriety”
(1775), afforded him plenty of scope in this direction,
and he availed himself fully of the opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
The absence of capital letters from some of the instances
in this poem may perhaps be taken to reflect a confusion
in the poet’s mind as to whether he was indulging in
personification or in mere abstraction, to adopt
Coleridge’s remark anent Gray’s use of this figure.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>In “The Village,” Crabbe’s first poem of any real
merit, there is a more sparing use, yet instances are
even here plentiful, whilst his employment of the
device had not died out when in the early years of the
nineteenth century he resumed his literary activities.
Among the poems published in the 1807 volume there
is a stiff and cumbrous allegory entitled “The Birth
of Flattery,” which, introduced by three Spenserian
stanzas, depicts Flattery as the child of Poverty and
Cunning, attended by guardian satellites, “Care,”
“Torture,” “Misery,” <i>et hoc omne genus</i>. They
linger on to the time of the “Posthumous Tales,”
where there is a sad, slow procession of them, almost,
we might imagine, as if they were conscious of the
doom pronounced years before, and of the fact that
they were strangers in a strange land:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet Resignation in the house is seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Subdued Affliction, Piety serene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Hope, for ever striving to instil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The balm for grief, “It is the heavenly will.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(XVIII, 299 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is not perhaps too fanciful to see in this lament a
palinode of the personifications themselves, sadly
resigning themselves to an inevitable fate.</p>

<p>Towards the ultimate triumph of the new poetry
the work of William Cowper represents perhaps the
most important contribution, judging at least from
the viewpoint both of its significance as indicating new
tendencies in literature, and of its immediate influence
on readers and writers. In the narrow sense of style<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the “simplicity” which was Cowper’s ideal was only
occasionally marred by the conventional phraseology
and bombastic diction which he himself laid to the
charge of the “classical” school, and his gradual
emancipation from the tenets and practices of that
school is reflected in his steady advance towards the
purity of expression for which he craved. And in
this advance it is to be noted that the gradual disappearance
of personified abstractions is one of the
minor landmarks.</p>

<p>The earlier work furnishes instances of the common
type of mere abstraction where there is no attempt
to give any real personification. Even in the “Olney
Hymns” (1779) such verses as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But unbelief, self-will</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Self-righteousness and pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How often do they steal</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My weapon from my side</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">only seem to present the old mechanical figures in a
new setting.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> The long series of satiric poems that
followed draw freely upon the same “mythology,” and
indeed the satires that appear in this 1782 volume
recall to some extent the style of Churchill.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
is a somewhat similar, though more restricted, use of
personified abstraction, and, as in Churchill’s satires,
virtues and vices are invested with slight human
qualities and utilized to enforce moral and didactic
truths. Thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Peace follows Virtue as its sure reward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Pleasure brings as surely in her train</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Remorse and Sorrow and Vindictive Pain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Progress of Error”)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the short pieces in this volume are the
famous lines put into the mouth of Alexander Selkirk,
which contain a fine example of the apostrophic
personification, the oft-quoted</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Solitude! where are thy charms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That sages have seen in thy face,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where the passion and sincerity of the appeal give
dignity and animation to an otherwise lifeless abstraction,
and, despite the absence of detail, really call up
a definite picture.</p>

<p>From the blank verse of his most famous work
nearly every trace of the mechanical abstraction has
disappeared—a great advance when we remember
that “The Task” is in the direct line of the moral
and didactic verse that had occupied so many of
Cowper’s predecessors.</p>

<p>The first Books (“The Sofa”) contain but one
instance and that in a playful manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ingenious Fancy, never better pleased</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than when employed to accommodate the fair.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(ll. 72 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Fourth Book (“The Winter Evening”) is
entirely free from instances of the mechanical abstraction,
but the vision of Oriental Empire, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
fascination of the East, is effectively evoked in the
personification of the land of the Moguls:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Is India free? and does she wear her plumed</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And jewelled turban with a smile of peace.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(ll. 28-9)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Task,” however, has two examples of the
detailed personification. The first is an attempt, in
the manner of Spenser, to give a full length portrait
of “a sage called Discipline”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His eye was meek and gentle and a smile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Played on his lips, and in his speech was heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Paternal sweetness</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(Bk. II, l. 702 foll.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where there is a depth of feeling, as well as a gentle
satiric touch in the delineation, that animate it into
something more than a mere stock image; it embodies
perhaps a reminiscence of one who at some time or
other had guided the destinies of the youthful Cowper.</p>

<p>The second instance is of a more imaginative kind.
It is the presentation, in the Fourth Book, of Winter,
with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">forehead wrapt in cloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A leafless branch thy sceptre,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">almost the only occasion on which Cowper, despite
the nature of his subject, has personified the powers
and orders of nature.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Cowper has also invested the
Evening with human attributes, and despite the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
imitative ring of the lines,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and the “quaintness” of
the images employed, there is a new beauty in the
evocation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, Evening, once again, season of peace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Return, sweet Evening, and continue long!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Methinks I see thee in the streaky west</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With matron step slow-moving, while the night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Treads on thy sweeping train.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The darkness soon to fall over the landscape is suggested
in the added appeal to Evening to come</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Not sumptuously adorned, nor needing aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like homely-featured Night, of clustering gems,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where the compound epithet emphasizes the contrast
between the quiet beauty of the twilight skyscape
and the star-sprinkled gloom of the night.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the last instances of the personified
abstraction to be found in the work of Cowper may
perhaps be taken to reflect something of the changes
that have been silently working underneath. This
is in the lines that suddenly bring “Yardley Oak”
to an end:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">History not wanted yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaned on her elbow watching Time whose course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eventful should supply her with a theme.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At first glance we seem to have here but the old
conventional figures, but there is an imaginative
touch that helps to suggest a new world of romance.
“History leaning on her elbow” has something at
least of that mysterious power of suggestion that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Wordsworth himself was to convey by means of the
romantic personification, such as those shadowy
figures—Fear and Trembling Hope, and Death the
Skeleton, and Time the Shadow—which gathered round
and hallowed the shade of the yew trees in Borrowdale.</p>

<p>But even while the old poetry was in its death
agony a champion was at hand, daring to maintain a
lost cause both by precept and example. This was
Erasmus Darwin, whose once-famous work “The
Botanic Garden,” with its two parts, “The Loves of
the Plants” (1789), and “The Economy of Vegetation”
(1791), has earlier been mentioned.</p>

<p>It met with immediate success. Darwin seems to
have fascinated his contemporaries, so that even
Coleridge was constrained in 1802 to call him “the
first literary character in Europe.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> He had, however,
little real admiration for “The Botanic Garden,”
and later expressed his opinion unmistakably.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> “The
Botanic Garden” soon died a natural death, hastened
no doubt by the ridicule it excited, but inevitably
because of the fact that the poem is an unconscious
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a style already doomed.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
The special matter with which we are concerned in
this chapter had for Darwin a marked significance,
since it fitted in admirably with his general doctrine or
dogma that nothing is strictly poetic except what is
presented in visual image. His “theory” was that,
just as the old mythologies had created a whole world
of personified abstractions to explain or interpret
natural phenomena of every description, exactly by
the same method the scientific thought and developments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
of his own age could be poetically expounded so
as to captivate both the hearts and minds of his
readers. It was his ambition, he said, “to enlist
imagination under the banner of science.” This
“theory” is expounded in one of the interludes placed
between the different cantos. “The poet writes
principally to the eye,” and allegory and personifications
are to be commended because they give visible
form to abstract conceptions.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Putting his theory
into practice, Darwin then proceeds with great zeal
to personify the varied and various scientific facts
or hypotheses of physics, botany, etc., metamorphosing
the forces of the air and other elements into sylphs
and gnomes and so on. Thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon shall thy arm, Unconquered</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Steam afar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drag the slow barge or drive the</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Rapid car.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(E.V., Canto I, 289, 290)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the same way all the plants, as classified by
Linnæus, are personified as “swains” or “belles”
who “love” and quarrel, and finally make it up
just as ordinary mortals do:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All wan and shivering in the leafless glade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sad Anemone reclin’d her head</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(L.P., Canto I, 315-6)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Retiring Lichen climbs the topmost stone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And drinks the aerial solitude alone.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(<i>Ibid.</i>, 347-8)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole poem is thus one long series of mechanical
personifications which baffle and bewilder and finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
wear out the reader. It is strange now to think that
“The Botanic Garden” was at the height of its vogue
when the “Lyrical Ballads” were being planned and
written, but the easy-flowing couplets of Darwin,
and the “tinsel and glitter” of his diction, together
with most of the “science” he was at such pains to
expound (though he was a shrewd and even prophetic
inquirer in certain branches, such as medicine and
biology), have now little more than a faint historical
interest. Yet his theory and practice of poetry—the
“painted mists that occasionally rise from the
marshes at the foot of Parnassus,” Coleridge called
them—so dominated the literature of the last decade
of the eighteenth century as to be capable of captivating
the mind of the poet who was about to sound
their death-knell.</p>

<p>While Wordsworth inveighed against “personification”
in the great manifesto, his earliest poetry
shows clearly, as has been noted, that in this as in
other respects he had fallen under the spell and
influence of “The Botanic Garden.” The “Evening
Walk” and the “Descriptive Sketches” swarm with
instances of personifications of the type that had
flourished apace for a hundred years, “Impatience,”
“Pain,” “Independence,” “Hope,” “Oppression,”
and dozens similar.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> There is thus a certain comic
irony in the fact that the poet, who was the first to
sound the revolt against “personifications” and
similar “heightenings” of style, should have embarked
on his literary career with the theft of a good deal of the
thunder of the enemy. Later, when Wordsworth’s
true ideal of style had evolved itself, this feature of
the two poems was in great measure discarded. The
first (1793) draft of the “Descriptive Sketches” contains
over seventy examples of more or less frigid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
abstractions; in the final draft of the poem these
have dwindled down to about a score.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>In our detailed examination of personification in
eighteenth century poetry we have seen that in
general it includes three main types. There is first
the mere abstraction, whose distinctive sign is the
presence of a capital letter; it may be, and often is,
qualified by epithets suggestive of human attributes,
but there is little or no attempt to give a definite
picture or evoke a distinctive image. This is the
prevalent type, and it is against these invertebrates
that the criticism of Wordsworth and Coleridge was
really directed.</p>

<p>Their widespread use in the eighteenth century is
due to various causes. In the first place they represent
a survival, however artificial and lifeless, of the great
mediaeval world of allegory, with its symbolic representation
derived from the pagan and classical
mythologies, of the attributes of the divine nature,
and of the qualities of the human mind, as living
entities. But by now the life had departed from
them; they were hopelessly effete and had become
consciously conventional and fictitious.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>They also owed their appearance, as indicated
above, to more definite literary causes and “fashions”;
they swarm especially, for instance, in the odes of
the mid-century, the appearance of which was mainly
due to the influence of “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso.”
The virtues and vices, the “shadowy tribes
of the mind,” which are there unceasingly invoked
and dismissed are mechanical imitations of the figures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
that the genius of Milton had been able to inspire
with real poetic value and life. They play
their part similarly and just as mechanically in
the didactic and satirical verse characteristic of the
period.</p>

<p>But whether regarded as a sort of literary flotsam
and jetsam, or as one of the symptoms of “Milton-mad”
verse, these personifications are nearly all
enfeebled by weaknesses inherent in their very genesis.
Only a deep and intense conception of a mental
abstraction can justify any attempt to personify
it poetically; otherwise the inevitable result is a
mere rhetorical ornament, which fails because it
conveys neither the “vast vagueness” of the abstract,
nor any clear-cut pictorial conception of the person.
Even with Gray, as with the mere poetasters who
used this figure to excess, it has the effect of a dull
and wearisome mannerism; only here and there, as
in the sonorous lines in which Johnson personified
Worth held down by Poverty, does the display of
personal emotion give any dignity and depth to the
image.</p>

<p>Again, the very freedom with which the conventional
abstractions are employed, allowing them to be
introduced on every possible occasion, tends to render
the device absurd, if not ludicrous. For the versifiers
seemed to have at their beck and call a whole phantom
army upon which they could draw whenever they
chose; for them they are veritable gods from the
machines. But so mechanical are their entrances and
exits that the reader rarely suspects them to be
intended for “flesh and blood creations,” though, it
may be added, the poetaster himself would be slow
to make any such claim. To him they are merely
part of his stock-in-trade, like the old extravagances,
the “conceits,” and far-fetched similes of the Metaphysical
school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>The second type of personification found in
eighteenth century verse needs but brief mention
here. It is the detailed personification where a full-length
portrait is attempted. Like the mere abstraction
it, too, is a survival of mediaeval allegory, and it
is also most often a merely mechanical literary process,
reflecting no real image in the poet’s mind. It is not
found to any large extent, and in a certain measure
owes its presence to the renewed interest in Spenser.
The Spenserian imitations themselves are comparatively
free from this type, a sort of negative
indication of the part played by the revival in the new
Romantic movement.</p>

<p>The third type is perhaps best described as the
embryonic personification. It consists in the attributing
of an individual and living existence to the
visible forms and invisible powers of nature, a disposition,
deeply implanted in the human mind from
the very dawn of existence, which has left in the
mythologies and creeds of the world a permanent
impress of its power. In eighteenth century literature
this type received its first true expression in the work
of Thompson and Collins, whilst its progress, until it
becomes merged and fused in the pantheism of Wordsworth
and Shelley, may be taken as a measure of
the advance of the Romantic movement in one of its
most vital aspects.</p>

<p>Regarded on its purely formal side, that is, as part
and parcel of the <i>language</i> of poetry, the use of personification
may then be naturally linked up with the
generally literary development of the period. In
the “classical” verse proper the figure employed is,
as it were, a mere word and no more; it is the reflex
of precisely as much individual imagination as the
stock phrases of descriptive verse, <i>the flowery meads</i>,
<i>painted birds</i>, and so on. There was no writing with
the inner eye on the object, and the abstraction as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
result was a mere rhetorical label, corresponding to
no real vision of things.</p>

<p>The broad line of advance in this, as in other aspects
of eighteenth century literature, passes through the
work of those who are now looked upon as the forerunners
of the Romantic revolt. The frigid abstraction,
a mere word distinguished by a capital letter,
is to be found in “The Seasons,” but alongside there
is also an approach to definite pictorial representation
of the object personified. In the odes of Collins the
advent of the pictorial image is definitely and triumphantly
announced, and though the mechanical
abstractions linger on even until the new poetry has
well established itself, they are only to be found in
the work of those who either, like Johnson and Crabbe,
belong definitely as regards style to the old order, or
like Goldsmith and, to a less extent, Cowper, reflect
as it were sort of half-way attitude towards the old
and the new.</p>

<p>With Blake the supremacy of the artistic personification
is assured. His mystical philosophy in its
widest aspect leads him to an identification of the
divine nature with the human, but sometimes this
signification is to be seen merging into a more conscious
symbolism, or even sinking into that “totally
distinct and inferior kind of poetry” known as
allegory. Yet with Blake the poet, as well as Blake
the artist, the use of personified abstraction is an
integral part of the symbolism he desired to perpetuate.
His imagination ran strongly in that
direction, and it has been aptly pointed out that his
most intense mental and emotional experiences
became for him spiritual persons. But even where
the presence of a capital letter is still the only distinguishing
mark of the personification, he is
able, either by the mere context or by the addition
of a suggestive epithet, to transform and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
transfigure the abstraction into a poetical emblem
of the doctrine whose apostle he believed himself
to be.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the use of personification
and abstraction, even in their narrower
applications as rhetorical ornaments or artifices of
verse, were not banished from English poetry as a
result of Wordsworth’s criticism. Ruskin has drawn
a penetrating distinction between personification and
symbolism,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and it was in this direction perhaps that
Wordsworth’s protest may be said to have been of the
highest value. His successors, for the most part,
distrustful of mere abstractions, and impatient of
allegory, with its attendant dangers of lifeless and
mechanical personification, were not slow to recognize
the inherent possibilities of symbolism as an artistic
medium for the expression of individual moods and
emotions, and it is not too much to say that in its
successful employment English poetry has since won
some of its greatest triumphs.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DICTION OF POETRY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>After years of comparative neglect, and, it
must be admitted, a good deal of uncritical
disparagement, the “age of prose and reason”
would seem at last to have come into its own. Or at
any rate during recent years there has become evident
a disposition to look more kindly on a period which
has but seldom had justice done to it. The label
which Matthew Arnold’s dictum attached to a good
portion, if not the whole, of the eighteenth century
seems to imply a period of arid and prosaic rationalism
in which “the shaping spirit of imagination” had no
abiding place, and this has no doubt been partly
responsible for the persistency of an unjust conception.
But it is now more generally recognized that,
in prose and even in poetry, the seventy or eighty
years, which begin when Dryden died, and end when
William Blake was probably writing down the first
drafts of his “Poetical Sketches,” had some definite
and far from despicable legacies to pass on to its
successors, to the writers in whom the Romantic
revival was soon to be triumphantly manifested.
The standards in all branches of literature were to be
different, but between “classical” and “romantic”
there was not to be, and indeed could not be, any great
gulf fixed. There was continuity and much was
handed on. What had to be transformed (and of
course the process is to be seen at work in the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
height of the Augustan supremacy) were the aims and
methods of literature, both its matter in large measure,
and its style.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>It is the poetry of the period with which we are
specially concerned, and it is in poetry that the
distinction between the old order and the new was
to be sharpest; for the leaders of the revolt had been
gradually winning new fields, or re-discovering old
ones, for poetry, and thus in more than one sense the
way had been prepared for both the theory and
practice of Wordsworth. Then came the great
manifestoes, beginning with the Preface of 1798, followed
by an expansion in 1800 and again in 1802;
fifteen years later, Coleridge, with his penetrating
analysis of the theories advanced by his friend and
fellow-worker, began a controversy, which still to-day
forms a fruitful theme of discussion.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, in launching his famous declaration
of principle on the language fit and proper for metrical
composition, had no doubt especially in mind the
practice of his eighteenth century predecessors. But
it has to be remembered that the <i>Prefaces</i> deal in
reality with the whole genesis of “what is usually
called poetic diction,” and that the avowed aim and
object was to sweep away “a large portion of phrases
and figures of speech, which from father to son have
long been regarded as the common inheritance of
poets.” The circumstances of the time, and perhaps
the examples chosen by Wordsworth to illustrate
his thesis, have too often led to his attack being
considered as concerned almost entirely with the
poetical language of the eighteenth century. Hence,
whenever the phrase “poetic diction” is mentioned
as a term of English literary history, more often than
not it is to the eighteenth century that the attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
is directed, and the phrase itself has taken on a
derogatory tinge, expressive of a stereotyped language,
imitative, mechanical, lifeless. For in the reaction
against eighteenth century styles, and especially
against the polished heroic couplet, there arose a
tendency to make the diction of the period an object
of undistinguishing depreciation, to class it all in one
category, as a collection of conventional words and
phrases of which all poets and versifiers felt themselves
at liberty to make use.</p>

<p>An actual analysis of eighteenth century poetry
shows us that this criticism is both deficient and misleading;
it is misleading because it neglects to take
any account of that eighteenth century poetical
language which Pope, inheriting it from Dryden,
brought to perfection, and which was so admirable
a vehicle for the satiric or didactic thought it had to
convey; it is deficient in that it concentrates attention
mainly on one type or variety of the language,
used both by poets and poetasters, and persists in
labelling this type either as the “eighteenth century
style proper,” or, as if the phrases were synonymous,
“the Pope style.”</p>

<p>One formula could no more suffice in itself for the
poetic styles of the eighteenth century than for those
of the nineteenth century; we may say, rather, that
there are then to be distinguished at least four distinct
varieties or elements of poetical diction, in the narrow
sense of the term, though of course it is scarcely
necessary to add that none of them is found in complete
isolation from the others. There is first the
stock descriptive language, the usual vehicle of expression
for that large amount of eighteenth century
verse where, in the words of Taine, we can usually
find “the same diction, the same apostrophes, the
same manner of placing the epithet and rounding the
period,” and “regarding which we know beforehand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
with what poetic ornaments it will be adorned.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In
reading this verse, with its lifeless, abstract diction,
we seldom or never feel that we have been brought
into contact with the real thoughts or feelings of
living men. Its epithets are artificial, imitative,
conventional; though their glare and glitter may
occasionally give us a certain pleasure, they rarely
or never make any appeal to our sensibility. As
someone has said, it is like wandering about in a land
of empty phrases. Only here and there, as, for
instance, in Dyer’s “Grongar Hill,” have the <i>gradus</i>
epithets taken on a real charm and beauty in virtue
of the spontaneity and sincerity with which the poet
has been inspired.</p>

<p>The received doctrine that it was due in the main
to Pope’s “Homer” is unjust; many of the characteristics
of this conventional poetical language were
established long before Pope produced his translation.
They are found to an equal, if not greater, extent in
Dryden, and if it is necessary to establish a fountain-head,
“Paradise Lost” will be found to contain most
of the words and phrases which the eighteenth century
versifiers worked to death. If Pope is guilty in any
degree it is only because in his work the heroic couplet
was brought to a high pitch of perfection; no doubt
too the immense popularity of the “Homer” translation
led to servile imitation of many of its words,
phrases, and similes. Yet it is unjust to saddle Pope
with the lack of original genius of so many of his
successors and imitators.</p>

<p>But the underlying cause of this conventional
language must be sought elsewhere than in the mere
imitation of any poet or poets. A passage from the
“Prelude” supplies perhaps a clue to one of the
fundamental conditions that had enslaved poetry in
the shackles of a stereotyped language. It takes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
form of a sort of literary confession by Wordsworth
as to the method of composing his first poems, which,
we have seen, are almost an epitome of the poetical
vices against which his manifestoes rebelled. He
speaks of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">the trade in classic niceties</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From languages that want the living voice</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">(“Prelude,” Bk. VI, ll. 109-112)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these lines we have summed up one of the main
Romantic indictments against the practice of the
“classical” poets, who were too wont to regard the
language of poetry as a mere collection or accepted
aggregate of words, phrases, and similes, empty of all
personal feeling and emotion.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Wordsworth, too, in this passage not unfairly describes
the sort of atmosphere in which diction of the stock
eighteenth century type flourished. The neo-classical
interpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine of poetry
as an imitation had by the time of Pope and his school
resulted in a real critical confusion, which saw the
essence of poetry in a slavish adherence to accepted
models, and regarded its ideal language as choice
flowers and figures of speech consecrated to poetry
by traditional use, and used by the poet very much
as the painter uses his colours, that is, as pigments
laid on from the outside. That this doctrine of
imitation and parallelism directly encourages the
growth of a set poetic diction is obvious; the poet’s
language need not be the reflection of a genuine
emotion felt in the mind: he could always find his
words, phrases, and figures of speech in accepted and
consecrated models.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>The reaction against this artificial diction is fundamental
in the Romantic revolt from another cause
than that of poetic form. The stock poetic language,
we have seen, occurs mainly in what may be called
the “nature” poetry of the period, and its set words
and phrases are for the most part descriptive terms of
outdoor sights and sounds. Among the many descriptions
or explanations of the Romantic movement is
that it was in its essence a “return to Nature,” which
is sometimes taken to imply that “Nature,” as we in
the twentieth century think of it, was a sudden new
vision, of which glimpses were first caught by James
Thomson, and which finally culminated in Wordsworth’s
“confession of faith.” Yet there was, of
course, plenty of “nature poetry” in the neo-classical
period; but it was for the most part nature from the
point of view of the Town, or as seen from the study
window with a poetical “Thesaurus” at the writer’s
side, or stored in his memory as a result of his reading.
It was not written with “the eye on the object.”
More fatal still, if the neo-classical poets did look,
they could see little beauty in the external world;
they “had lost the best of the senses; they had
ceased to perceive with joy and interpret with insight
the colour and outline of things, the cadence of sound
and motion, the life of creatures.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>This sterility or atrophy of the senses had thus a
real connexion with the question of a conventional
poetical language, for the descriptive diction with its
stock words for the sea, the rivers, the mountains, the
sky, the stars, the birds of the air and their music,
for all the varied sights and sounds of outdoor
life—all this is simply a reflex of the lack of
genuine feeling towards external nature. Keats, with
his ecstatic delight in Nature, quickly and aptly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
pilloried this fatal weakness in the eighteenth century
versifiers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its gathering waves—ye felt it not. The blue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of summer nights collected still to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The morning precious: beauty was awake!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why were ye not awake! But ye were dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To things ye knew not of—were closely wed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To musty laws lined out with wretched rule</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And compass vile: so that ye taught a school</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip and fit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, like the certain wands of Jacob’s wit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their verses tallied; Easy was the task</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of Poesy.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that two great changes or advances
were necessary, if poetry was to be freed from the
bondage of this conventional diction. In the first
place, the poet must reject root and branch the traditional
stock of words and phrases that may once have
been inspiring, but had become lifeless and mechanical
long before they fell into disuse; he must write with
his eye on the object, and translate his impressions
into fresh terms endowed with real, imaginative power.
And this first condition would naturally lead to a
second, requiring every word and phrase to be a
spontaneous reflection of genuine feeling felt in the
presence of Nature and her vast powers.</p>

<p>The neo-classical poetry proper was not without
verse which partly satisfied these conditions; direct
contact with nature was never entirely lost. Wordsworth,
as we know, gave honourable mention<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> to
“The Nocturnal Reverie” of Anne, Countess
Winchilsea, written at the very height of the neo-classical
supremacy, in which external nature is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
described with simplicity and fidelity, though there
is little trace of any emotion roused in the writer’s
mind by the sights and sounds of outdoor life. And
every now and then, amid the arid and monotonous
stretches of so much eighteenth century verse, we are
startled into lively interest by stumbling across, often
in the most obscure and unexpected corners, a phrase
or a verse to remind us that Nature, and all that the
term implies, was still making its powerful appeal
to the hearts and minds of men, that its beauty and
mystery was still being expressed in simple and heartfelt
language. Thomas Dyer’s “Grongar Hill” has
already been mentioned; it was written in 1726,
the year of the publication of Thompson’s “Winter.”
Dyer, for all we know, may have the priority, but in
any case we see him here leading back poetry to the
sights and sounds and scents of external nature, which
he describes, not merely as a painter with a good eye
for landscape, but as a lover who feels the thrill and
call of the countryside, and can give exquisite expression
to his thoughts and emotions. We have only
to recall such passages as</p>

<p>These two are among the more famous of their time,
but a close search amongst the minor poetry of the
mid-eighteenth century will bring to light many a
surprising instance of poetry written with an eye on
the object, as in John Cunningham’s (1729-1773)
“Day,”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> where the sights and sounds of the countryside

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the great bulk of neo-classical verse is unaffected
by the regained and quickened outlook on the external
world. It is in the forerunners of the Romantic
revolt that this latter development is to be most
plainly noted: when, as the result of many and varied
causes English poets were inspired to use their eyes
again, they were able, slowly and in a somewhat
shallow manner at first, afterwards quickly and
profoundly, to “sense” the beauty of the external
world, its mysterious emanations of power and beauty.
This quickening and final triumph of the artistic
sense naturally revealed itself in expression; the
conventional words and epithets were really doomed
from the time of “Grongar Hill” and “The Seasons,”
and a new language was gradually forged to express
the fresh, vivid perceptions peculiar to each poet,
according as his senses interpreted for him the face of
the world.</p>

<p>A second variety of eighteenth century diction, or,
more strictly speaking, another conventional embellishment
of the poetry of the period, is found in that
widespread use of personified abstraction which is
undoubtedly one of the greatest, perhaps <i>the</i> greatest,
of its faults. Not only the mere versifiers, but also
many of its greatest poets, make abundant use of
cut and dried personifications, whose sole claim to
vitality rests most often on the presence of a capital
letter. It is a favourite indulgence of the writers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
not only of the old order, but also of those who, like
Collins and Gray, announce the advent of the new, and
not even the presence of genius could prevent its
becoming a poetical abuse of the worst kind. Whether
it be regarded as a survival of a symbolic system from
which the life had long since departed, or as a conventional
device arising from the theory of poetical
ornament handed down by the neo-classicists, its
main effect was to turn a large proportion of eighteenth
century poetry into mere rhetorical verse. It is this
variety of poetical language that might with justice
be labelled as the eighteenth century style in the
derogatory sense of the term. In its cumulative
effect on the poetry of the period it is perhaps more
vicious than the stock diction which is the usual target
of criticism.</p>

<p>Two other varieties of eighteenth century diction
represent an endeavour to replace, or rather reinforce
the stereotyped words, phrases, and similes by new
forms. The first of these is the widespread use of
latinized words and constructions, chiefly in the
blank verse poems written in imitation of Milton, but
not only there. The second is the use of archaic and
pseudo-archaic words by the writers whose ambition
it was to catch something of the music and melody of
the Spenserian stanza. Both these movements thus
reflected the desire for a change, and though the
tendencies, which they reflect, are in a certain sense
conventional and imitative in that they simply seek
to replace the accepted diction by new forms derived
respectively from Milton and Spenser, one of them at
least had in the sequel a real and revivifying influence
on the language of poetry.</p>

<p>The pedantic and cumbrous terms, which swarm
in the majority of the Miltonic imitations, were
artificial creations, rarely imbued with any trace of
poetic power. Where they do not actually arise from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
deliberate attempts to imitate the high Miltonic manner,
they probably owe their appearance to more or less
conscious efforts to make the new blank verse as
attractive as possible to a generation of readers
accustomed to the polished smoothness of the couplet.
Though such terms linger on until the time of Cowper,
and even invade the works of Wordsworth himself,
romanticism utterly rejected them, not only because
of a prejudice in favour of “Saxon simplicity,” but
also because such artificial formations lacked almost
completely that mysterious power of suggestion and
association in which lies the poetical appeal of words.
Wordsworth, it is true, could win from them real
poetic effects, and so occasionally could Thomson,
but in the main they are even more dead and dreary
than the old abstract diction of the neo-classicals.</p>

<p>The tendency towards archaism was much more
successful in this respect, because it was based on a
firmer foundation. In harking back to “the poet’s
poet,” the eighteenth century versifiers were at least
on a right track, and though it was hardly possible,
even with the best of them, that more than a faint
simulacrum of the music and melody of the “Faerie
Queene” could be captured merely by drawing drafts
on Spenser’s diction, yet they at least helped to blaze
a way for the great men who were to come later.
The old unknown writers of the ballads and Spenser
and the Elizabethans generally were to be looked
upon as treasure trove to which Keats and Scott and
Beddoes and many another were constantly to turn
in their efforts to revivify the language of poetry, to
restore to it what it had lost of freshness and vigour
and colour.</p>

<p>The varieties or embellishments of poetical diction,
which have just been characterized, represent the
special language of eighteenth century poetry, as
distinct from that large portion of language which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
common alike to prose and poetry. For it is scarcely
necessary to remind ourselves that by far the largest
portion of the poetry of the eighteenth century (as
indeed of any century) is written in the latter sort of
language, which depends for its effects mainly upon the
arrangement of the words, rather than for any unique
power in the words themselves. In this kind of
poetical diction, it is not too much to say that the
eighteenth century is pre-eminent, though the effect
of the Wordsworthian criticism has led to a certain
failure or indisposition to recognize the fact. Just as
Johnson and his contemporaries do not give direct
expression to any approval of the admirable language,
of which Pope and some of his predecessors had such
perfect command, so modern criticism has not always
been willing to grant it even bare justice, though
Coleridge’s penetrating insight had enabled him, as
we have seen, to pay his tribute to “the almost faultless
position and choice of words, in Mr. Pope’s <i>original</i>
compositions, particularly in his Satires and Moral
Essays.” It was, we may imagine, the ordinary
everyday language, heightened by brilliance and
point, in which Pope and his coterie carried on their
dallyings and bickerings at Twickenham and elsewhere,
and it was an ideal vehicle, lucid and precise
for the argument and declamation it had to sustain.
But it was more than that, as will be readily recognized
if we care to recall some of the oft-quoted lines
which amply prove with what consummate skill Pope,
despite the economy and condensation imposed by
the requirements of the closed couplet, could evoke
from this plain and unadorned diction effects of
imagination and sometimes even of passion. Such
lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">He stooped to Truth and moralised his song,</div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">or</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and dozens similar, show the lucidity, energy, and
imaginative picturesqueness with which Pope could
endow his diction when the occasion required it.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Such language is the “real language of men”; nearly
every word would satisfy the Wordsworthian canon.</p>

<p>And the same thing is true to a large extent of the
poets, who are usually considered as having taken
Pope for their model. Whenever there is a real
concentration of interest, whenever they are dealing
with the didactic and moral questions characteristic
of the “age of prose and reason,” whenever they are
writing of man and of his doings, his thoughts and
moods as a social member of civilized society, their
language is, as a rule, adequate, vivid, fresh, because
the aim then is to present a general thought in the
language best adapted to bring it forcibly before the
mind of the reader. Here, as has been justly said,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
rhetoric has passed under the influence and received
the transforming force of poetry. “The best rhetorical
poetry of the eighteenth century is not the best poetry,
but it is poetry in its own way, exhibiting the glow,
the rush, the passion which strict prose cannot, and
which poetry can, give.” Judged on the basis of this
kind of poetical diction, the distinctions usually drawn
between the neo-classical “kind” of language in the
eighteenth century and the romantic “kind” all tend
to disappear; at the head (though perhaps we should
go back to the Dryden of the “Religio Laici” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
“The Hind and the Panther”) is the “Essay on
Criticism”; in the direct line of descent are Akenside’s
“Epistle to Curio,” large portions of “The Seasons,”
“The Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,”
“The Vanity of Human Wishes,” the “Deserted
Village,” and at the end of the century, the “Village”
of Crabbe. And in another <i>genre</i>, but just as good in
its own way, is that light verse, as it may perhaps best
be called, successfully ushered in, at the very beginning
of the century, by John Pomfret’s “The Choice,”
and brought to perfection by Matthew Prior in his
lines “To a Child of Quality,” and many another
piece.</p>

<p>Nor must it be forgotten that there is a large amount
of eighteenth century minor poetry which, whilst
reflecting in the main the literary tendency of the age
in its fondness for didactic verse, presented in the guise
of interminably long and dull epics and epistles, yet
reveals to us, if we care to make the pilgrimage through
the arid stretches of Anderson’s “British Poets,” or
Dodsley’s “Collection of Poets by Several Hands,”
or Bell’s “Fugitive Poetry,” or similar collections,
the simple, unambitious works of poets more or less
unknown when they wrote and now for the most part
forgotten, who, unconscious or ignorant of the accepted
rules and regulations of their time, wrote because
they felt they must, and thus had no care to fetter
themselves with the bondage of the “classical”
diction.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Their range was limited, but they were
able to express their thoughts and fancies, their little
idylls and landscapes in plain English without any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
trimmings, akin in its unaffected diction and simplicity
of syntax to the language of the genuine old ballads,
which were so largely and, for the most part, ineffectively,
if not ludicrously, imitated throughout the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The Augustan age, then, was not without honour,
even in poetry, where, looking back after Romanticism
had won and consolidated its greatest triumphs, it
would seem everything had gone wrong, there was not
a little from which the rebels themselves might well
have profited. Nowadays we are accustomed, perhaps
too often, to think of the Romantic forerunners, the
poet of “The Seasons,” and Gray, and Collins, and
Goldsmith, and the rest, as lonely isolated outposts
in hostile territory. So they were to a large extent,
but they could not, of course, altogether escape the
form and pressure of their age; and what we now
admire in them, and for which we salute them as the
heralds of the Romantic dawn, is that which shows
them struggling to set themselves free from the
“classical” toils, and striving to give expression to
the new ideas and ideals that were ultimately to surge
and sing themselves to victory. It is scarcely necessary
to recall many a well-known passage, in which,
within a decade of the death of Pope, or even before
the mid-century, these new ideas and ideals had found
expression in language which really sounded the death-knell
of the old diction. Fine sounds, Keats within
a few decades was to proclaim exultantly, were then
to be heard “floating wild about the earth,” but
already as early as Collins and Gray, and even now
and then in “The Seasons,” words of infinite appeal
and suggestiveness were stealing back into English
poetry.</p>

<p>And this leads us to a consideration of the poetic
diction of the eighteenth century from a more general
standpoint. For no discussion of poetical language<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
can be complete unless an attempt is made to consider
the question in its entirety with a view to the question
of what really constitutes poetic diction, what it is
that gives to words and phrases, used by certain poets
in certain contexts, a magic force and meaning. The
history of poetic diction from the very beginning of
English literature down to present times has yet to be
written, and it would be a formidable task. Perhaps
a syndicate of acknowledged poets would be the only
fit tribunal to pass judgment on so vital an aspect of
the craft, but even then we suspect there would be a
good deal of dissension, and probably more than one
minority report. But the general aspects of the
question have formed a fruitful field of discussion since
Wordsworth launched his theories<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and thus began
a controversy as to the exact nature of poetic language,
the echoes of which, it would seem, have not yet died
away. For the Prefaces were, it may be truly said,
the first great and definite declaration of principle concerning
a question which has been well described as
“the central one in the philosophy of literature, What
is, or rather what is not, poetic diction?”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Judged from this wider standpoint, the diction of
the “classical” poetry of the eighteenth century,
and even of a large portion of the verse that announces
the ultimate Romantic triumph, seems to have marked
limitations. The widespread poverty and sterility
of this diction was not, of course, merely the result of
an inability to draw inspiration from Nature, or of a
failure to realize the imaginative possibilities of words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and phrases: it was, it would almost seem, the
inevitable outcome and reflex of an age that, despite
great and varied achievements, now appears to us
narrow and restricted in many vital aspects. If
poetry is a criticism of life, in the sense in which
Matthew Arnold doubtless meant his dictum to be
taken, the age of Pope and his successors is not
“poetic”; in many respects it is a petty and tawdry
age—the age of the coffee-house and the new press, of
the club and the coterie. There are great thinkers like
Hume, great historians like Gibbon, great teachers
and reformers like John Wesley; but these names and
a few others seem only to throw into stronger light the
fact that it was on its average level an age of talk
rather than of thought, of “fickle fancy” rather than
of imaginative flights, of society as a unit highly
organized for the pursuit of its own pastimes, pleasures,
and preoccupations, in which poetry, and literature
generally, played a social part. Poetry seems to skim
gracefully over the surface of life, lightly touching
many things in its flight, but never soaring; philosophy
and science and satire all come within its
purview, but when the eternally recurring themes of
poetry<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>—love and nature and the like—are handled,
there is rarely or never poignancy or depth.</p>

<p>The great elemental facts and thoughts and feelings
of life seldom confront us in the literature of the
century as we make our way down the decades; even
in the forerunners of the Romantic revolt we are never
really stirred. “The Seasons,” and “The Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard,” touch responsive
chords, but are far from moving us to thoughts beyond
the reaches of our souls. Not until Blake and Burns
is the veneer of convention and artificiality, in both
matter and manner, definitely cast aside, and there is
to be caught in English verse again, not only the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
authentic singing note, but, what is more, the recognition
and exemplification of the great truth that the
finest poetry most often has its “roots deep in the
common stuff,” and it is not to be looked for in an age
and environment when, with rationality apparently
triumphant, men seemed careless of the eternal
verities, of the thoughts and feelings that lie too deep
for tears, or sadly recognized their impotence, or
their frustrated desires, to image them forth in
poetry.</p>

<p>“What is it,” asks Gilbert Murray,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> “that gives
words their character and makes a style high or low?
Obviously, their associations: the company they
habitually keep in the minds of those who use them.
A word which belongs to the language of bars and
billiard-saloons will become permeated by the normal
standard of mind prevalent in such places; a word
which suggests Milton or Carlyle will have the flavour
of those men’s minds about it. I therefore cannot
resist the conclusion that if the language of Greek
poetry has, to those who know it intimately, this
special quality of keen austere beauty, it is because
the minds of the poets who used that language were
habitually toned to a higher level both of intensity
and of nobility than ours. It is a finer language
because it expresses the mind of finer men. By
‘finer men’ I do not necessarily mean men who
behaved better, either by our standards or by their
own: I mean the men to whom the fine things of the
world, sunrise and sea and stars, and the love of man
for man, and strife and the facing of evil for the sake
of good, and even common things like meat and drink,
and evil things like hate and terror had, as it were, a
keener edge than they have for us, and roused a
swifter and nobler reaction.” This passage has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
quoted in full because it may be said to have a direct
and definite bearing on the question of the average
level of poetic language during the greater part of the
eighteenth century: there were few or no <i>trouvailles</i>,
no great discoveries, no sudden releasings of the
magic power often lurking unsuspectedly in the most
ordinary words, because the poets and versifiers for
the most part had all gone wrong in their conception
of the medium they essayed to mould. “The substance
of poetry,” writes Professor Lowes,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> “is also
the very stuff of words. And in its larger sense as
well the language of poetry is made up inevitably of
symbols—of symbols for things in terms of other
things, for things in terms of feelings, for feelings in
terms of things. It is the language not of objects, but
of the complex relations of objects. And the agency
that moulds it is the ceaselessly active power that is
special to poetry only in degree—<i>imagination</i>—that
fuses the familiar and the strange, the thing I feel and
the thing I see, the world within and the world without,
into a <i>tertium quid</i>, that interprets both.” The
eighteenth century was not perhaps so emphatically
and entirely the “age of prose and reason” as is sometimes
thought, but it could scarcely be called the “age
of imagination,” and poetry, in its highest sense
(“high poetry,” as Maeterlinck would call it), being
of imagination all compact, found no abiding place
there.</p>

<p>Most words, we may say, potentially possess at least
two or more significations, their connotative scope
varying according to the knowledge or culture of the
speaker or reader. First of all, there is the logical,
their plain workaday use, we might call it; and next,
and above and beyond all this, they have, so to speak,
an exciting force, a power of stimulating and reviving
in the mind and memory all the associations that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
cluster around them. Nearly all words carry with
them, in vastly varying degrees, of course, this power
of evocation, so that even commonplace terms, words,
and phrases hackneyed and worn thin by unceasing
usage, may suddenly be invested with a strange and
beautiful suggestiveness when they are pressed into
the service of the highest poetic imagination.
And in the same way the æsthetic appeal of words of
great potential value is reinforced and strengthened,
when in virtue of their context, or even merely of the
word or words to which they are attached, they are
afforded a unique opportunity of flashing forth and
bringing into play all the mysterious powers and
associations gathered to themselves during a long
employment in prose and verse, or on the lips of the
people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All the charm of all the muses</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">often flowering in a lonely word.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Poetry of the highest value and appeal may be,
and often is, as we know from concrete examples that
flash into the mind, written in commonplace, everyday
terms, and we ask ourselves how it is done.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
There are the mysterious words of the dying Hamlet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The rest is silence,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the line quoted by Matthew Arnold<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> as an instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
when Wordsworth’s practice is to be found illustrating
his theories:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And never lifted up a single stone,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or the wonderful lines which seem to bring with them
a waking vision of the beauty of the English countryside,
radiant with the promise of Spring:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">daffodils,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That come before the swallow dares, and take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The winds of March with beauty.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these and many similar passages, which the reader
will recall for himself, it would seem that the mere
juxtaposition of more or less plain and ordinary words
has led to such action and reaction between them as
to charge each with vastly increased powers of evocation
and suggestion, to which the mind of the reader,
roused and stimulated, instinctively responds.</p>

<p>Similarly, the satisfaction thus afforded to our
æsthetic sense, or our emotional appreciation, is often
evoked by a happy conjunction of epithet and noun
placed together in a new relation, instantly recognized
as adding an unsuspected beauty to an otherwise colourless
word. The poets and versifiers of the eighteenth
century were not particularly noteworthy for their
skill or inspiration in the matter of the choice of
epithet, but the genius of Blake, in this as in other
respects of poetic achievement, raised him “above the
age” and led him to such felicities of expression as in
the last stanza of “The Piper”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And I made a <i>rural pen</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I stained the water clear,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">where, as has been aptly remarked,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> a commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
epithet is strangely and, apparently discordantly,
joined to an equally commonplace noun, and
yet the discord, in virtue of the fact that it sets
the mind and memory working to recover or recall
the faint ultimate associations of the two terms,
endows the phrase with infinite suggestiveness. In
the same way a subtle and magic effect is often
produced by inversion of epithet, when the adjective
is placed after instead of before the noun, and this
again is a practice or device little favoured in the
eighteenth century; the supremacy of the stopped
couplet and its mechanical requirements were all
against it.</p>

<p>But the eighteenth century had little of this magic
power of evocation; the secret had departed with the
blind Milton, and it was not till the Romantic ascendancy
had firmly established itself, not until Keats
and Shelley and their great successors, that English
poetry was once more able so to handle and fashion
and rearrange words as to win from them their total
and most intense associations. Yet contemporary
criticism, especially in France, had not failed
altogether to appreciate this potential magic of
words. Diderot, for instance, speaks of the magic
power that Homer and other great poets have
given to many of their words; such words are, in his
phrase, “hieroglyphic paintings,” that is, paintings
not to the eye, but to the imagination.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> What we
feel about all the so-called classical verse of the
eighteenth century, as well as of a good deal of the
earlier Romantic poetry, is that writers have not been
able to devise these subtle hieroglyphics; lack of real
poetical inspiration, or the pressure of the prosaic and
unimaginative atmosphere of their times, has led to a
general poverty in the words or phrases that evoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
some object before the inner eye, or charm the ear by
an unheard melody, terms that, like the magic words
of Keats, or the evanescent imagery of Shelley, stir
us both emotionally and æsthetically. The verse of
Pope and his followers is not without something of
this power, but here the effect is achieved by the skill
and polish with which the words are selected and
grouped within the limits of the heroic couplet. Crabbe
had marked down, accurately enough, this lack of
word-power in his description of Dryden’s verse as
“poetry in which the force of expression and accuracy
of description have neither needed nor obtained
assistance from the fancy of the writer,” and again,
more briefly, as “poetry without an atmosphere.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
One negative indication of this “nudity” is the comparative
poverty of eighteenth century poetry in new
compound epithets, those felicitous terms which have
added to the language some of its most poetical and
pictorial phrases.</p>

<p>The Prefaces of Wordsworth and the kindred comments
and remarks of Coleridge were not, it is hardly
necessary to say, in themselves powerful enough to
effect an instant and complete revolution in poetical
theory and practice. But it was all to the good that
inspired craftsmen were at last beginning to worry
themselves about the nature and quality of the
material which they had to mould and fashion and
combine into poetry; still more important was it that
they were soon to have the powerful aid of fellow-workers
like Shelley and Keats, whose practice was
to reveal the magic lurking in words and phrases, so
arranged and combined as to set them reverberating
in the depths of our sensibility. And, on the side of
form at least, this is the distinctively Romantic
achievement; the æsthetic possibilities and potentialities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of the whole of our language, past and present,
were entrancingly revealed and magnificently exemplified;
new and inexhaustible mines of poetical word-power
were thus opened up, and the narrow and
conventional limits of the diction within which the
majority of the eighteenth century poets had “tallied”
their verses were transcended and swept away.</p>

puzzled is seen by the history of the term “concertion.” This was
the spelling of the first and most of the subsequent editions, including
that of 1787, where the Glossary explains it as meaning
“contrivance.” But some editions (e.g. 1751) have “consertion,”

checked as far as possible by reference to the “New English

being assigned, as regards its first appearance, to any
individual writer, is not in itself evidence that he himself invented
the new formation, or even introduced it into literature. But in
many cases, either from the nature of the compound itself, or from
some other internal or external evidence, the assumption may be
made.</p>

that flourished exceedingly at this time have little interest in this
respect. Shenstone has very few instances of compounds, but the
poems of William Thompson furnish a few examples: “<i>honey-trickling</i>
streams” (“Sickness,” Bk. I), “<i>Lily-mantled</i> meads”

of any special merit; but a verse of his Pindar shows that he was

defined, and (appropriately enough) illustrated: “<i>Prosopopeia</i>,
the change of things to persons, as ‘Confusion heard his voice.’”</p>

symbolism, and is far less noble. Symbolism is the setting forth of
a great truth by an imperfect and inferior sign ... and it is
almost always employed by men in their most serious moods
of faith, rarely in recreation.... But Personification is the
bestowing of a human or living form upon an abstract idea; it is
in most cases, a mere recreation of the fancy, and is apt to disturb
the belief in the reality of the thing personified.”</p>
